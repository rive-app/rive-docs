As our Rive editor adds features for making Rive assets, sometimes our runtimes need to be updated to support these improvements. This may mean new or changed APIs.

Check below to see if a given feature used by your Rive asset is supported yet at runtime. We generally recommend that your project uses the latest version of the runtimes to take advantage of follow-on bug fixes and new features.

<Warning>
  Certain features require the use of the Rive Renderer at runtime. See our
  documentation on [choosing a renderer](/runtimes/choose-a-renderer/).
  Currently, the only feature that requires the Rive Renderer is **[Vector
  Feathering](https://rive.app/blog/introducing-vector-feathering)**.
</Warning>

We may include notes on migrating to newer versions if a new feature warrants recent API changes.

## Support by Runtime

## Support by Feature

<AccordionGroup>

  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="scripting">
    Support for Rive files with [Scripting](/docs/scripting).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="dataBindingListsImagesArtboards">
      Data binding lists, images, and artboards were added after initial data binding support.

      See [Data Binding Overview](/editor/data-binding/overview) and [Data Binding for Runtimes](/runtimes/data-binding).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="rightToLeftLayoutsText" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="textFollowPath" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="dataBinding">
      See [Data Binding Overview](/editor/data-binding/overview) and [Data Binding for Runtimes](/runtimes/data-binding).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
      <FeatureSupportGroup feature="vectorFeathering" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="nSlicing">
      See [N-Slicing](/editor/layouts/n-slicing).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="layouts">
      Allows Rive to automatically update the artboard size as the underlying view/canvas/widget/texture size changes. See [Layouts](/editor/layouts/layouts-overview).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="fallbackFonts">
      Allows Rive to use a fallback font if a glyph is not available. A default font is automatically chosen, or you can optionally configure the desired fallback font based on various options. See [Fallback Fonts](/runtimes/text#fallback-fonts).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="nestedText">
      Enables setting text on component instances. See [Nested Text](/runtimes/text#read-update-nested-text-runs-at-runtime).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="nestedInputs">
      Enables setting inputs on component instances. See [Nested Inputs](/runtimes/inputs#nested-inputs).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="randomization">
      Enables randomizing transitions between animations and customizing the probability.
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="audio">
      See [Rive Events](/runtimes/rive-events) and [Audio Events](/editor/events/audio-events).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="nestedInputsAndEvents">
      See [Components](/editor/fundamentals/components).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="outOfBandAssets">
      See [Loading Assets](/runtimes/loading-assets).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="events">
      See [Rive Events](/runtimes/rive-events).
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="text">
      See [Text](/runtimes/text).

      Note that we will proactively update the above versions as additional APIs on runtimes expose ways to dynamically set text (high and low-level), among other related features.
  </FeatureSupportGroup>
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="followPath" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="interpolationOnStates" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="joysticks" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="solos" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="speedOnStates" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="graphEditor" />
  <FeatureSupportGroup feature="listeners">
      No extra code is needed to support listeners, and you do not need to invoke listeners via event listener/detector code at runtime. If the Rive file has a listener as part of the state machine at design time, the runtime library has implicit event listener/detector code to trigger the listeners at the appropriate time.

      ## Notes
      - `rive-react` - Starting in `v3.0.0` the React runtime has split into two different published packages; `@rive-app/react-canvas` and `@rive-app/react-webgl`, each wrapping the respective `@rive-app/canvas` and `@rive-app/webgl` web runtimes. We recommend using `@rive-app/react-canvas`
      - `@rive-app/webgl` - There is a new flag here, `useOffscreenRenderer` which is off by default. This flag will allow you to work around the various browser constraints on the number of WebGL contexts created. We **highly recommend** setting this option to `true` when instantiating Rive in the high-level API. See more here: [https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm#other-notes](#nested-inputs-and-nested-events).
      - `rive-react-native` - Starting in `v3.0.0`, it will have a minimum iOS `14.0` support

      - Regarding web-based runtimes and meshes:
          - Keep in mind that as meshes grow across larger screen areas, they become more resource-heavy on some devices
          - Avoid complex transforms repeatedly on the `canvas` elements that display Rive animations (or `RiveComponent` in the React runtimes)
          - We recommend using `@rive-app/webgl` to display mesh on Firefox for best performance
