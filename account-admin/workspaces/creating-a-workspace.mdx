## Free Workspace

Create a workspace for free and invite an unlimited number of workspace members. [Free plan limits](/account-admin/pricing#individual-free-plan) still apply.

There is a button in the editor to create a new workspace.

Name your workspace.

Invite your workspace members. You can select the role for the workspace member in the dropdown once you've entered their email address.

- Editor: can view and edit all files in the workspace
- Admin: can add and remove members to the workspace as well as edit and view all the files in the workspace
- Viewer: can view the files but cannot edit them

If you accidentally type in an incorrect email address or add someone you do not want to include, you can remove them before creating the workspace. Once you are ready, click on "Create Workspace." Invitations to the workspace will be emailed to each person you added as soon as the workspace is created.

<Info>
  If you have multiple Rive accounts with different email addresses (e.g., a work email address account and a personal email address account), log out of Rive BEFORE accepting the invite. Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect to the Rive account you are currently logged into.

## Paid Workspace

If you currently have a free account with Rive and wish to subscribe to a paid plan, you must log in to your account.

The editor has a "Free" button next to your existing free workspace in the left menu.
