If you type in the wrong email address or add someone you don't wish to add, you can remove them before creating the workspace 

Click on "Create Workspace."

Workspace invites are emailed out to each person you added to your workspace as soon as the workspace is created.

<Info>We recommend that people create a free Rive account before accepting the emailed invite.
If you have multiple Rive accounts with different email addresses (I.E. you have a work email address account and a personal email address account) log out of Rive BEFORE accepting the invite. Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect the Rive account you are currently logged into.</Info> 

## Paid Workspace 

If you currently have a free account with Rive and wish to subscribe to a paid plan, you must log in to your account.

The editor has a "Free" button in the left menu next to your existing free workspace.
