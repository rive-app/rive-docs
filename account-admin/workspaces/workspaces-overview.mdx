title: "Workspaces Overview"
---

Workspaces are how you organize files in Rive—whether you're working solo or with a team.

- Everyone has their own personal workspace
- Teams and companies get a dedicated workspace
- You can be a member of multiple workspaces (personal, company, freelance projects, etc.)
- Each workspace is billed separately—upgrading one doesn't upgrade the others

Use the workspace switcher in the editor to toggle between them.
