1. **Why do my friend and I both have to pay to collaborate? We both have paid workspaces.**

   Rive charges per seat per workspace. If you're an editor in multiple workspaces, each workspace pays for your seat separately. To collaborate, one of you invites the other to their workspace—and that workspace pays for the seat.
2. **I upgraded but it still says my workspace is free.**

   You probably upgraded a different workspace. Use the workspace switcher (click the arrow next to your workspace name) to find your paid workspace.

3. **My subscription lapsed and now the price is higher. Can I get my old price back?**

   If you had legacy pricing, it was locked in as long as your subscription stayed active. Once canceled, we can't reinstate it—you'll need to resubscribe at current prices.
4. **I upgraded but only one workspace changed. Why aren't all my workspaces paid now?**

   Each workspace is billed separately. Upgrading one doesn't affect the others.
