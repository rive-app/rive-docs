1. **I have a paid workspace, and my friend has a paid workspace. Why do we need to pay to collaborate on a file?**

   Rive charges per seat, and those seats are associated with a workspace, not an individual user. If a user is an editor in multiple workspaces, the user's seat will be counted and billed against the respective workspace's plan. You are billed for all seats on your plan, whether the user has accepted their invite or not.
   
2. **I paid to upgrade my workspace, but it's telling me it's still free. Where is my paid workspace?**

   We created the Workspace Switcher to help you see your different workspaces. If you upgraded your plan and received a receipt, click on the arrow next to your workspace name and switch workspaces.

3. **My account cancelled and I cannot get the price I had before. The new pricing is higher. Why can't I get my old pricing back?**

   We locked in our Legacy pricing for our longtime users. As long as the account remains active, we will not automatically increase the price of your plan. However, we cannot reinstate your Legacy pricing if your account cancels. You will have to resubscribe at the new prices.

4. **I paid to upgrade my workspace, but it only upgraded one workspace. Why aren't all of my workspaces now paid?**

   Rive allows users to be members of multiple workspaces. Paying to upgrade one workspace only upgrades that workspace.
