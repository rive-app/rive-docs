title: "Inviting Workspace Members"
---

Rive offers [free](/account-admin/workspaces/creating-a-workspace#free-workspace) and [paid](/account-admin/workspaces/creating-a-workspace#paid-workspace) workspaces. Upgrading one workspace to paid does not upgrade all of your workspaces.

Collaborating with others is easy with workspaces to work on a project or track progress.

There are three different types of workspace members:

- Editor: can view and edit all files in the workspace
- Admin: can add and remove members to the workspace as well as edit and view all the files in the workspace
- Viewer: can view the files but cannot edit them

You can invite someone to your workspace during or after workspace creation.

## Inviting during workspace creation

[Create your free workspace](/account-admin/workspaces/creating-a-workspace#free-workspace).

Name your workspace.

Invite your workspace members. You can select the role for the workspace member in the dropdown once you've entered in their email address.

If you type in the wrong email address or add someone you don't wish to add, you can remove them before creating the workspace.

Click on "Create Workspace."

When the workspace is created, invites are emailed out to each person you added to your workspace.

On the right sidebar, you can see the status of your workspace. In this case, the team is Free, and each person who has been invited has not yet accepted their invite. Any outstanding invite will have "_pending_" behind it. When they accept the invite, the "_pending_" status is removed.

Each member's role is listed. You can change it by clicking on it and selecting a new role from the dropdown menu.

## Inviting After Workspace Creation - Free Workspace

If you have an active workspace (either free or paid) and would like to invite someone to join, there are two ways to do this:

1. You can invite them directly from the editor.
2. You can invite them from your Account page.

Locate the workspace information on the right side to invite someone from the editor. Click on the "Invite" tab to get started.

This opens up a new tab where you can invite members to your workspace.

Enter the individual's email address and click "Add." Once you click "Add," the email address will appear below, allowing you to select the type of workspace permissions you want to grant that person. You will also see a list of current members in your workspace and the cost of adding a new member to the team. Since this is a free team, there is no cost associated with adding a new member, regardless of their role.

Click "Confirm" to send the person an invite to your workspace.

Once you click "Confirm," you will be redirected to the Workspace page in your account. This page shows you what type of workspace you have and who you have invited to it.

<Info>
  If you have multiple Rive accounts with different email addresses (e.g., a work email address account and a personal email address account), log out of Rive BEFORE accepting the invite. Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect to the Rive account you are currently logged into.

Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect to the Rive account you are currently logged into.
