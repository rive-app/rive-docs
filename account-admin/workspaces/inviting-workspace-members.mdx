Rive offers [free](https://rive.app/community/doc/creating-a-team/doc1Lp7GBtnV#free-teams) and [paid](https://rive.app/community/doc/creating-a-team/doc1Lp7GBtnV#paid-teams--) workspaces. 

Collaborating with others is easy with workspaces to work on a project or track progress.

There are three different types of workspace members:

- Editor: can view and edit all files in the workspace
- Admin: can add and remove members to the workspace as well as edit and view all the files in the workspace
- Viewer: can view the files but cannot edit them 

You can invite someone to your workspace during or after workspace creation.

## Inviting during workspace creation

[Create your free workspace](https://rive.app/community/doc/creating-a-team/doc1Lp7GBtnV).

Name your workspace.

Invite your workspace members. You can select the role for the workspace member in the dropdown once you've entered in their email address.

If you type in the wrong email address or add someone you don't wish to add, you can remove them before creating the workspace. 

Click on "Create Workspace."

When the workspace is created, invites are emailed out to each person you added to your workspace. 

On the right sidebar, you can see the status of your workspace. In this case, the team is Free and each person who has been invited has not accepted their invite yet. Any outstanding invite will have "*pending*" behind it. When they accept the invite, the "*pending*" status is removed.

The role for each member is listed. You can change their role by clicking on it and selecting a new role from the dropdown menu.

## Inviting After Workspace Creation - Free Workspace

You have an active workspace (free or paid) and you wish to invite someone to your workspace. 

There are two ways to invite someone to your active workspace:

1. You can invite them directly from the editor. 
2. You can invite them from your Account page.

On the right side of the editor is the workspace information. Click on the "Invite" tab.

This opens up a new tab where you can invite members to your workspace.

Type in their email address and click "Add." Once you click "Add," the email address shows up below and you can select what type of workspace permissions you wish to grant to that person. You will also see a list of what types of members are on your workspace and the cost of adding a new person to the team. This is a free team, so there is no cost, regardless of the role you choose.

Once you click "Confirm," you will be redirected to the Workspace page in your account. This shows you what type of workspace you have and everyone you have invited to your workspace. 

<Info>We recommend that people create a free Rive account before accepting the emailed invite. If you have multiple Rive accounts with different email addresses (I.E. you have a work email address account and a personal email address account) log out of Rive BEFORE accepting the invite. Regardless of the email address the invite was emailed to, clicking to accept the invite will connect the Rive account you are currently logged into.</Info>
