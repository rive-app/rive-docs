## How to Invite

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. Find the workspace in the left sidebar
3. Click "Manage Workspace"
4. Click "Invite Members"
5. Enter their email address and press Enter
6. Select their role from the dropdown
7. Click "Confirm & Pay"

They'll receive an email invitation. For paid workspaces, you're charged a pro-rated amount immediately for any Editor or Admin seats.

You can also invite directly from the editor: click "Manage Workspace" in the right sidebar.

**Can't invite someone?**

Check that you've verified your email address. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account) → Profile tab → click "Resend verification email" on the right if needed.

## ⚠️ For People Accepting Invites

If you have multiple Rive accounts (e.g., work and personal), **log out before clicking the invite link**. The invite connects to whatever account you're currently logged into—not necessarily the email the invite was sent to.
