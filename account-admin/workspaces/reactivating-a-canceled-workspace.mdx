title: "Reactivating a Canceled Workspace"
---

<Warning>
  If you accidentally create a NEW workspace instead of reactivating an existing one, please email us at [support@rive.app](), and we will assist you in canceling the incorrect workspace.

   

  Please note that we cannot transfer payments between workspaces. We can only cancel the incorrect workspace and issue a refund.

   

  Additionally, we are unable to move files from one workspace to another. If you have files saved in the incorrect workspace, please ensure that you download your backup files (.rev files) BEFORE canceling the workspace. To create a backup file, right-click on the file and select "Download backup." This will generate a .rev file, which serves as a complete backup of your original file.
</Warning>

To reactivate the correct workspace, you will need to go to your account page: https://rive.app/account/

Partway down the page, you will see a section labeled “Workspaces.”

To the right of each workspace is a link that says “Manage Workspace.” If you select the link on the left that says “Create new Workspace,” you will create a **NEW** workspace and not upgrade an existing workspace.

<Info>
  You can own and be a member of multiple workspaces: paid and free.
</Info>

Its status is under each workspace's name. A green Active status means this workspace is active, and a red Suspended status means it has been canceled.

Click on “Manage Workspace.” Each workspace has a display name and a username, both of which can be changed.

If you have multiple workspaces with the same display name, please check the username associated with each one to determine which workspace you would like to reactivate. If you're unsure which workspace to choose, feel free to email us at [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app), and we will help you locate the correct workspace.

If you only have one workspace, that is the one you want to reactivate.

In the Plan section, you will find two links: "Reactivate Plan" and "Delete Workspace." Click on "Reactivate Plan" to proceed.

You are now on the reactivation page. Here, you can select your billing option: a yearly plan (paid upfront for the entire year) or a monthly plan (paid every month). Regardless of the billing option you choose, you will see the total cost before completing your purchase.
