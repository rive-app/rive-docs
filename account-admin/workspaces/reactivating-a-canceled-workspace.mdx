## ⚠️ Don't Create a New Workspace by Mistake

"Create new Workspace" is **not** the same as reactivating. If you have multiple workspaces, double-check you're reactivating the right one—each workspace has a display name and a username.

**If you accidentally created a new workspace instead of reactivating:** Email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app). We can cancel the incorrect workspace and refund you, but we can't transfer payments or files between workspaces. If you saved files in the wrong workspace, download your backups (.rev files) before we cancel it.
