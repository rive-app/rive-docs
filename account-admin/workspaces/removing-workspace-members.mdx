As long as you are an admin, you can remove people from your workspace at any time.

Go to your account page: [https://rive.app/account/](https://rive.app/account/)

Under Workspaces, you will see a list of all of the workspaces you own or are a member of. 

Click on Manage Workspace to the right of the page.

This takes you to their information page.

On this page you can:

1. Remove a person's admin status
2. Remove the person from the workspace
3. If you are part of the workspace, from here you can leave the workspace 

<Info>The only person you **cannot** remove from a workspace is the owner of the workspace. If you need to remove the owner of the workspace or you are the owner and you wish to leave the workspace, contact us at [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app). We can assist you in making this change.</Info>
