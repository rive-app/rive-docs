Your account settings live at [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account).

You can also get there by clicking your name (top-left corner) → Manage Account.

From here you can:

- Update your email, password, or profile
- Manage your workspaces and billing
- View notifications
- Manage share links for your files

Your workspaces are listed in the left sidebar. Click "Manage Workspace" next to any workspace to change its plan, update payment, or invite members.
