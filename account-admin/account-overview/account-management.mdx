**Profile:** This shows the information about the workspace. You can update this by clicking "Edit Profile".

**Manage Billing**: This link takes you to a Stripe page. You can update your billing information, change your payment method, and add a VAT number if necessary.

**Members**: If you are part of a paid workspace, you can view your workspace members here. You will see who the workspace owner (yourself) is, and any other workspace members will be listed. Clicking on "Invite Members" will allow you to type in an email address. Once you hit enter, the email address is shown below, and you can click on the box to make that person an admin. You will be given information on what adding that person will cost and your next billing. They are not invited to the workspace until you click the "Confirm & Pay" button. Once you confirm the change, an invite to the workspace will be emailed out, and you will be charged for adding the new person to your workspace.
