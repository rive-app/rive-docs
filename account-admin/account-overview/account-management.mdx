**Notifications**: This is where any notifications you have will appear.

Here is where you find:

**Workspaces**:

The left side of the page shows a list of your workspaces. You can have multiple workspaces and be a member and/or owner of multiple workspaces.

Each workspace has a name, and under the name is the status of the workspace.

- Active: The workspace is active and paid.
- Active (ends on a specific date): This workspace is set to cancel at the end of the billing cycle.
- Suspended: The workspace is canceled.
- Failed Payment: The payment failed, and the workspace is canceled.

To manage the workspace, click "Manage Workspace" to the right.

**Profile:** This shows the information about the workspace. You can update this by clicking "Edit Profile".

**Manage Billing**: This link takes you to a Stripe page. You can update your billing information, change your payment method, and add a VAT number if necessary.

**Members**: If you are part of a paid workspace, you can view your workspace members here. You will see who the workspace owner (yourself) is, and any other workspace members will be listed. Clicking "Invite Members" will allow you to type in an email address. Once you hit enter, the email address is shown below, and you can click the box to make that person an admin. You will be given information on the cost of adding the person and your next billing. They are not invited to the workspace until you click the "Confirm & Pay" button. Once you confirm the change, an invite to the workspace will be emailed out, and you will be charged for adding the new person to your workspace.
