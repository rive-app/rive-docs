**The link in the email no longer works. How can I download my receipts?**

The links do not stay active indefinitely. You should download your receipt within a week before the link is deactivated. 

To access your prior receipts, log in to your account and access your account admin page: [rive.app/accountâ€‹](https://rive.app/account/)

Under "Workspaces" is the list of workspaces you are part of. Locate the workspace for which you wish to download the receipt and click "Manage Plan."

On the workspaces management page, scroll down to "Billing."

Click on the "Manage Billing" link on the right.

You will be directed to a secure Stripe page. Your Invoice History for this workspace is at the bottom of the Stripe page. Clicking on the date for each invoice will open the invoice for you in a different window. You can then download a PDF of your receipt and/or invoice.
