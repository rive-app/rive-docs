Invoice links in email expire after about a week. If your link no longer works, you can always download invoices directly from your account.

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. Find the workspace in the left sidebar
3. Click "Manage Workspace"
4. Click "Manage Billing" (opens Stripe)
5. If prompted, enter your email—Stripe will send you a login link
6. Scroll to the bottom to view your invoice history
7. Click any invoice date to open it, then download the PDF

Check your spam folder if the Stripe email doesn't arrive within a few minutes.
