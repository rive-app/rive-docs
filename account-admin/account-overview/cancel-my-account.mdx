title: "Cancel My Subscription"
---

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. Find the workspace in the left sidebar
3. Click "Manage Workspace"
4. Click "Cancel Plan"
5. You'll be redirected to Stripe—click "Cancel Plan" to confirm

You'll keep access until the end of your current billing period. After that, the workspace moves to a free plan.

Once you set your subscription to cancel, you can't make other account changes until the cancellation processes at the end of your billing period. If you change your mind or need to make changes, contact [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) to remove the pending cancellation first.

**Want to delete the workspace entirely?** That's different—see [Delete a Workspace](/home/account-admin/workspaces/delete-a-workspace)
