## "Invalid credentials" error

Two common causes:

**1. You signed up with Google or Facebook** If you created your account using Google or Facebook login, we don't have a password stored—that's managed by them. Use the Google or Facebook sign-in button instead of email/password.

**2. Wrong password** Click "Forgot password?" below the login button. We'll email you a reset link.
