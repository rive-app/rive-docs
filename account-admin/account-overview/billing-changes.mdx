⚠️ If you have a pending change (like a scheduled cancellation), you can't make other billing changes until it's resolved. Contact [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) if you're stuck.

## Where to Manage Billing

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. Find your workspace under "Workspaces"
3. Click "Manage Workspace"

From here you can:

- **Change Plan** → Switch between Free and Voyager
- **Manage Billing** → Opens Stripe to update your payment card

⚠️ "Create a Workspace" creates a NEW workspace. It does not update your current plan.

---

## Update Your Payment Card

1. Click "Manage Billing" to open the Stripe Customer Portal
2. Go to "Payment Methods"
3. Add your new card
4. Click "Set as default"
5. Remove the old card (optional)

If your subscription was suspended due to failed payment, you'll need to resubscribe via the Upgrade button after updating your card. Access is restored within minutes.

---

## Change Your Plan

Click "Change Plan" from the Manage Workspace page to switch between Free and Voyager.

**Have legacy/grandfathered pricing?** Email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) and we'll process the change for you. This includes switching between monthly and annual billing.

---

## If Your Card Keeps Getting Declined

Call your bank first. Common issues:

- International transactions blocked (Rive uses Stripe)
- Bank flagged the charge as suspicious

After your bank clears it, wait 30 minutes and try again. Still not working? Try a different card or email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app).

## Multiple Workspaces?

Each workspace has its own billing. Make sure you're managing the right one—check the workspace name at the top of the Manage Workspace page.

---

## For Team Members

Only the workspace owner can update billing. If you're seeing access errors due to a payment issue, let the owner know.
