How do I change my card on file or change my billing plan?

[**NOTE: If you have a Legacy pricing plan and wish to change your billing from monthly to annual or vice versa, please submit a ticket here under the Account and Billing option. We can help you process the change.**](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)

**Clicking Create a Workspace creates a NEW workspace. It does NOT update your current workspace billing.**

If you wish to update your card on file to pay your subscription, you must log in to your account. You can access your account information here: [rive.app/accountâ€‹](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)

This is the page you will see:

If you have an active plan, it will be listed in the "Workspaces" section.

Click "Manage Workspace" to the right to update your billing and plan.

The Manage Workspace page has the workspace name at the top and links to make changes on the right side.

To change your plan, click "Change Plan." You can change from a free plan to a Voyager plan.

If you wish to change the card on file for your plan, select "Manage Billing." This takes you to a secure Stripe page where you can update your card or add a different card.
