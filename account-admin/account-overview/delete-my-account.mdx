Click on "Cancel Plan" on the right. Once you cancel your plan, you can then delete your workspace. The "Cancel Plan" link will now say "Delete Workspace." Delete your workspace and return to the main account page by clicking on Account at the top. Once your workspace is deleted, you can delete your entire Rive account.

## To delete a free account 

You must delete all workspaces in your account if you have a free plan. Once your workspace is deleted, you can delete your entire Rive account.

## What happens to my data after I delete my account?

Your account will be canceled immediately, and we delete all your data 90 days after cancellation.

Content you have contributed to a workspace or that other users have remixed from the Community will not be deleted.

If you are the owner of a workspace, access to the workspace will be suspended for all members. If you want the workspace to continue, please transfer ownership of the workspace by making another person an admin before canceling.

Please take a look at our [Terms of Service](../../legal/terms-of-service) for complete details on this.
