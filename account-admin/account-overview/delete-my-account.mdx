## Before You Can Delete

You need to remove all workspaces from your account first:

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. For each workspace you own:
   - Click "Manage Workspace"
   - If it's a paid plan, click "Cancel Plan" first
   - Then click "Delete Workspace"
3. Once all workspaces are removed, you can delete your account

## What Happens to Your Data

- Your account and data are deleted 90 days after cancellation
- Files you contributed to other people's workspaces are **not** deleted
- Content others have remixed from your Marketplace uploads is **not** deleted

## If You Own a Workspace With Members

Deleting your account suspends access for everyone in your workspace. If you want the workspace to continue, transfer ownership to another admin before deleting your account. See [Transfer Workspace Ownership](/home/account-admin/workspaces/transfer-workspace-ownership).

If you delete your account and later want to use the same email address, you won't be able to create a new account. Contact [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) to restore your account instead. Note: we cannot guarantee your files will still be available.
