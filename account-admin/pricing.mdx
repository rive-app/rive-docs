## Legacy Pricing

If you're on a legacy plan, your pricing is locked in as long as your subscription stays active. Adding users may move you to current pricing. If your subscription cancels, legacy pricing cannot be reinstated.

## Students

Rive offers a discounted Student Plan for individual students with a valid student email or documentation. The Student Plan is for personal educational work only—not for commercial use or team collaboration. Complete [this form](https://airtable.com/appUtquW7bOB1IIqA/pagYXiM10pusJxcdV/form) to request access to the Student Plan.

Schools, universities, and non-profits should use a standard Cadet or Voyager plan.
