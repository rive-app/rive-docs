Rive is free for individuals and supports paid plans for teams. Teams allow you to create a shared space where you and other team members can collaborate in real-time, no matter where you are.

<Warning>
  If you are currently subscribed to one of our Legacy pricing plans, we will not automatically change your pricing. You can invite additional users to your Workspace, but you will be bumped up to Voyager pricing at the time of the change.

  If your Legacy plan cancels, we cannot reinstate you at your old price. You will need to resubscribe using the current pricing.

## Education and non-profit discounts

Rive now offers a discounted Student Plan for individual students. This plan provides access to paid features for personal educational work. [Verification](https://portal.usepylon.com/rive/forms/account-file-support-form) is required through a student email address or approved documentation. The Student Plan cannot be used for commercial work or for team collaboration.

We do not offer separate pricing for schools, universities, or non-profit organizations. These groups should use a standard Cadet or Voyager workspace plan if they need shared projects or collaboration.
