Data binding allows you to establish connections between your Unity code and your Rive graphics. This creates a two-way reactive system where changes in your code affect the Rive design, and changes in the design can trigger responses in your code.

## Auto Binding in the Inspector

The simplest way to use data binding is through the Unity Inspector. The **Rive Widget** component includes a **Data Binding Mode** setting that offers three options:

![Data Binding Mode dropdown in Unity Inspector showing Auto Bind options](/images/unity/widget-db-binding-mode-dropdown.jpg)

- **Auto Bind Default**: Automatically binds the default view model instance (marked as "Default" in the Rive editor)
- **Auto Bind Selected**: Lets you select a specific instance from a dropdown
- **Manual**: Requires you to set up binding through code (see the [Data Binding documentation](/runtimes/data-binding) for details)



## Working with Data Binding

Once your **Rive Widget** is bound to a view model instance, you can access and modify its properties from your C# scripts.

For the full data binding API (including detailed ViewModel property types, lists, and artboard binding), see the runtime data binding documentation:

Explore the **RewardsDataBinding** scene in the [getting-started example project](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity-examples) for a practical implementation in Unity.

 If you choose to use the low-level API to control the render loop, you'll need to manually set up data binding in your scripts.

 For reference, check this [RiveScreen example](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity/blob/main/examples/basic/Assets/GameRuntime/RiveScreen.cs) that demonstrates one way to implement auto binding in a custom render loop.

<Note>
Using the low-level API requires additional implementation effort and understanding of the Rive runtime. Unless you have a specific need to setup a custom render loop, we recommend using the Component API.
