New to Rive? Start with the [Rive Editor](/editor/fundamentals/overview) to create your graphics, then [export for runtime](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime) when you're ready to bring them into Unity.

## Example Projects

To quickly experiment with Rive in Unity, run one of our [example projects](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity-examples).

## Installation

The Rive Unity package is available on the Unity Asset Store and on GitHub.

The **Unity Asset Store** has a simpler installation process and only includes the stable package releases. Installing from **GitHub** gives you access to stable releases as well as canary tags, which are updated more frequently and may include newer/early access features before they land in a stable release.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unity Asset Store">
    Install the package from the Unity Asset Store:

    - [Rive for Unity (Asset Store)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/rive-350858)

    <Steps>
      <Step>Open **Window -&gt; Package Manager**</Step>
      <Step>Select **My Assets**</Step>
      <Step>Find **Rive** and select **Download** / **Import**</Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub">
    The [rive-unity package](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity) is also available to install from GitHub using a git dependency.

    Add it via **Window -&gt; Package Manager** and choose **Add package from git URL...** (replace `0.0.0` with the [latest release](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity/releases)):

    ```bash
    https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity.git?path=package#v0.0.0
    ```

    <Steps>
      <Step>Open **Window -&gt; Package Manager**</Step>
      <Step>Choose **Add package from git URL...**</Step>
      <Step>
        Paste the URL with a version tag
        ![Image](/images/game-runtimes/unity/929bb6b6-2e4a-45c0-a09b-0c3d4f7c5361.webp)
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Note>
      Unity can occasionally crash when upgrading the packages while the Editor is running. If you experience this, close Unity first, update the version in `Packages/manifest.json`, then reopen the project.
    </Note>

    You can add it manually to your project's `Packages/manifest.json` (replace `0.0.0` with the [latest release](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity/releases)):

    ```json
    "app.rive.rive-unity": "https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity.git?path=package#v0.0.0"
    ```
  </Tab>

## Adding a Rive file to Unity

See our documentation on [Exporting](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime) graphics for runtime.

Once you have a `.riv` file, drag it into the Unity **Project** window. Unity will import it and automatically create a **Rive Asset** you can reference from components and scripts.

On the [Marketplace](https://rive.app/marketplace), you can find Rive files that can be remixed.

## Displaying a Rive File

**Drag-and-Drop**

To display a Rive file in UI, drag it into the **Scene Hierarchy**. This creates a screen-space setup inside a uGUI Canvas.

  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="https://ucarecdn.com/c6749dc5-66bb-4125-925c-363c32357881/"
></video>


<Note>
 The `com.unity.ugui` package must be installed to use these components. This is usually included by default in new Unity projects.
</Note>

To display a Rive file on a mesh, drop the Rive file onto an existing GameObject with a `MeshRenderer`. This creates a **Rive Panel** and adds a **Rive Texture Renderer** component to the mesh GameObject.

  className="w-full aspect-video"

**Quick Creation Menu**

Right-click in the scene hierarchy to create the following:

- `Rive > Rive Panel` - Creates a standalone panel
- `Rive > Rive Panel (Canvas)` - Creates a UI-ready panel
- `Rive > Widgets > Rive Widget` - Adds a standard Rive widget
