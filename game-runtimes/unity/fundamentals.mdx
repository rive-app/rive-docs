## Adding Rive Assets

To add a `.riv` file to a Unity project, simply drag it into the Project Window. Once dropped, a **Rive Asset** will be automatically created. 

Now you can display the Rive Asset within a **Rive Panel** and **Rive Widget** or create a custom script using the low-level API to display the graphic.

## File

A `Rive.File` contains Artboards, StateMachines, and Animations. 

<Note>
 If you're working with the Rive Panel and Rive Widgets components, the Rive Widget will automatically handle loading the underlying Rive File from the assigned Asset.<br/>
 You only need to use this class directly if you want control of the lifecycle of the Rive File, or if you need to load the file from an external source like a CDN.
</Note>

The `Rive.File` class also provides several methods to load Rive content into Unity:

<Note>
 If the file is already in memory, a cached version will be returned to improve performance and avoid redundant loading.
</Note>

#### 1. From a Rive Asset (.riv file)

You can load a `Rive.File` from an imported `.riv` asset in the inspector:

```csharp
public Rive.Asset asset; // pass in .riv asset in the inspector
private Rive.File m_file;

...

private void Start()
{
    if (asset != null)
    {
        m_file = Rive.File.Load(asset);
    }
}
```

#### 2. From a Unity TextAsset

You can load a `Rive.File` from a Unity `TextAsset`. This is useful if you have the bytes bundled as a `TextAsset` in the Unity project.

```csharp
public TextAsset riveTextAsset; // assign in the inspector
private Rive.File m_file;

...

private void Start()
{
    if (riveTextAsset != null)
    {
        m_file = Rive.File.Load(riveTextAsset);
    }
}
```

#### 3. From a Byte Array 

If you have the raw bytes of a `.riv` file, you can load it directly from a byte array. This method provides flexibility if you're loading the file data from a custom source or dynamically (e.g. from a CDN-stored file):

```csharp
private byte[] riveFileBytes; // Your byte array, loaded from remote storage, for example.
private Rive.File m_file;

...

private void Start()
{
    if (riveFileBytes != null)
    {
        m_file = Rive.File.Load(riveFileBytes, "myRiveFileName");

    }
}
```

## Artboards

 [Artboards](../../editor/fundamentals/artboards) contain [State Machines](../../editor/state-machine/state-machine) and Animations. 

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Components">

        Using a **Rive Widget** component, you can select from a list of available artboards within a given **Rive File**.

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Low-level API">

        Artboards are instantiated from a `Rive.File` instance:

        ```java
        private Artboard m_artboard;

        ...

        m_artboard = m_file.Artboard(0); // by index
        m_artboard = m_file.Artboard("Arboard 1"); // by name
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


## State Machines

A StateMachine contains Inputs and Events, for more information see Unity [State Machines](../../editor/state-machine/state-machine) and [Rive Events](../../runtimes/rive-events/).

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Components">

        Using a **Rive Widget** component, you can select from a list of available state machines within a given Artboard.

        ![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/157836bb-4e86-4893-8565-12905d477500/)

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Low-level API">

        State Machines are instantiated from an Artboard instance:

        ```csharp
        private StateMachine m_stateMachine;

        ...

        m_stateMachine = m_artboard?.StateMachine(); // default state machine
        m_stateMachine = m_artboard?.StateMachine(0); // state machine at index
        m_stateMachine = m_artboard?.StateMachine("Name"); // state machine with name
        ```

        They also control advancing (playing) an animation:

        ```csharp
        private void Update()
        {
            m_stateMachine?.Advance(Time.deltaTime);
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>




## Rendering

In Unity, Rive renders to a [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html) that you can display in your Scene by attaching to a [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html) or anywhere else you would use a Render Texture within your project. 

<Tabs>

    <Tab title="Components">

        The **Rive Panel** automatically renders its **Rive Widgets** to a Render Texture.

        Using the **Rive Canvas Renderer**, you can display a **Rive Panel** within a uGUI Canvas.

        To display a **Rive Panel** on a GameObject's mesh, use the **Rive Texture Renderer.**
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Low-level API">

        Layout and draw commands are managed through the `Rive.Renderer`.

        For a more complex example drawing a texture directly to a camera, see the **getting-started** project in the [examples repository](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unity-examples).

        The following is a basic example script behaviour to render a given Rive asset to the provided `renderTexture`. The animation is played by calling `.Advance()` on the State Machine.

        See [Animation Playback](../../runtimes/animation-playback)for more general information on playing animations and state machines at runtime.

        ```csharp
        using System.Collections;
        using UnityEngine;
        using UnityEngine.Rendering;
        using UnityEditor;
        using Rive;

        using LoadAction = UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderBufferLoadAction;
        using StoreAction = UnityEngine.Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction;

        public class RiveTexture : MonoBehaviour
        {
            public Rive.Asset asset;
            public RenderTexture renderTexture;
            public Fit fit = Fit.contain;
            public Alignment alignment = Alignment.Center;

            private Rive.RenderQueue m_renderQueue;
            private Rive.Renderer m_riveRenderer;
            private CommandBuffer m_commandBuffer;

            private Rive.File m_file;
            private Artboard m_artboard;
            private StateMachine m_stateMachine;

            private Camera m_camera;

            private void Start()
            {
                // If on D3d11, this is required
                renderTexture.enableRandomWrite = true;
                m_renderQueue = new Rive.RenderQueue(renderTexture);
                m_riveRenderer = m_renderQueue.Renderer();
                if (asset != null)
                {
                    m_file = Rive.File.Load(asset);
                    m_artboard = m_file.Artboard(0);
                    m_stateMachine = m_artboard?.StateMachine();
                }

                if (m_artboard != null && renderTexture != null)
                {
                    m_riveRenderer.Align(fit, alignment, m_artboard);
                    m_riveRenderer.Draw(m_artboard);

                    m_commandBuffer = m_riveRenderer.ToCommandBuffer();
                    m_commandBuffer.SetRenderTarget(renderTexture);
                    m_commandBuffer.ClearRenderTarget(true, true, UnityEngine.Color.clear, 0.0f);
                    m_riveRenderer.AddToCommandBuffer(m_commandBuffer);
                    m_camera = Camera.main;
                    if (m_camera != null)
                    {
                        Camera.main.AddCommandBuffer(CameraEvent.AfterEverything, m_commandBuffer);
                    }
                }
            }

            private void Update()
            {
                if (m_stateMachine != null)
                {
                    m_stateMachine.Advance(Time.deltaTime);
                }
            }

            private void OnDisable()
            {
                if (m_camera != null && m_commandBuffer != null)
                {
                    m_camera.RemoveCommandBuffer(CameraEvent.AfterEverything, m_commandBuffer);
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        1. Create a Unity [RenderTexture](https://docs.unity.cn/ru/2020.1/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html) and [Material](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/Materials.html) in Assets
        2. Assign the **RenderTexture** to the **Material**
        3. Drag this behaviour to a **GameObject** and attach the material
        4. Link the .riv asset and **RenderTexture** on the **RiveTexture** (custom script) behaviour
