title: 'Loading Assets'
---

Rive files can reference external assets such as images, fonts, and audio.  
In Unreal, these assets are loaded explicitly as part of the Rive file import and initialization process.

This page explains how asset loading works and what guarantees the runtime provides.

---

## What Counts as an Asset?

A Rive file may reference:

- Image assets
- Font assets
- Audio assets

These assets are defined in the Rive file and resolved at runtime through Unreal.

---

## Asset Loading Model

Asset loading in the Unreal runtime is:

- Explicit
- File-scoped
- Tied to Rive file initialization

Assets are not loaded lazily per Artboard.  
They are resolved when the Rive file is imported or initialized.

---

## Import-Time Asset Handling

When a `.riv` file is imported:

- Unreal creates a **Rive File** asset
- Referenced assets are discovered
- Asset metadata is recorded
- Unreal asset wrappers are created as needed

This step prepares the file for runtime use but does not render anything.

---

## Runtime Asset Resolution

At runtime, when a Rive file is initialized:

- The Rive runtime requests assets by identifier
- The Unreal asset loader resolves them
- Assets are cached for the lifetime of the Rive file

If an asset cannot be resolved:
- The file may still load
- The affected content may render incompletely
- Errors are reported through logging

---

## Asset Lifetime

Assets loaded for a Rive file:

- Are owned by the Rive file instance
- Remain valid while the Rive file is alive
- Are released when the Rive file is destroyed

Artboards do not own assets directly.

Destroying an Artboard does not unload assets.

---

## Multiple Artboards and Shared Assets

When multiple Artboards are created from the same Rive file:

- Assets are shared
- Assets are not duplicated per Artboard
- Memory usage scales with file count, not Artboard count

This allows multiple independent Artboards to render efficiently.

---

## Fonts and Text Assets

Text objects in Rive may reference fonts.

Font handling follows the same rules as other assets:
- Fonts are resolved during file initialization
- Missing fonts may cause fallback rendering
- Font changes require updating the source Rive file

Fonts are not dynamically swapped at runtime.

---

## Audio Assets

Audio assets may be referenced by Rive content.

Audio support may be limited depending on platform and configuration.

If audio assets are present:
- They are loaded through the same asset pipeline
- Playback behavior depends on runtime support
- Audio triggering is driven by ViewModel or state machine logic

---

## Asynchronous Loading Considerations

The Unreal runtime may perform asset loading asynchronously as part of initialization.

Important considerations:
- Artboards should not be used until initialization completes
- ViewModels and rendering assume assets are available
- Initialization completion should be treated as a readiness signal

Do not assume assets are available immediately after object creation.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using Artboards before the Rive file is initialized
- Assuming assets load per Artboard
- Destroying the Rive file while Artboards are still in use
- Expecting runtime asset
