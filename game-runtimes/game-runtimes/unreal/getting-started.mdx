This guide shows you how to install the Rive Unreal plugin, import a `.riv` file, and display it in your project.

If you’re new to Rive, see the Rive Editor documentation to learn how to create and export `.riv` files.

## Requirements

- Unreal Engine 5.7.1
- A `.riv` file exported from the Rive Editor

## Install the Plugin

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fab">
    1. Open the **Epic Games Launcher** or Unreal Editor.
    2. Open **Fab**.
    3. Search for **Rive** (or go to the [Rive plugin](https://www.fab.com/portal/listings/4a79a0af-7614-42bd-8857-5375c2668706/) page directly).
    4. Add the plugin to your engine or project.
    5. Restart Unreal Engine if prompted.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub">
    git clone https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal.git

    Copy the **Rive** plugin folder into your project’s **Plugins/** directory, then regenerate project files and build.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Enable the Plugin

1. Open **Edit → Plugins**.
2. Find **Rive** under **Runtime**.
3. Enable the plugin.
4. Restart the editor if required.

## Import a Rive File

1. Open the **Content Browser**.
2. Drag and drop a `.riv` file into your project.

Unreal creates a **Rive File** asset that contains the artboards, state machines, and ViewModels defined in the file.

## Display a Rive Animation

Rive content is rendered through an **Artboard**, which represents a runtime instance of a Rive artboard.

### Blueprint

Using Blueprints, you can:

- Create a Rive Artboard
- Assign a Rive File
- Select an Artboard and State Machine
- Advance and render the Artboard each tick

Blueprint nodes are provided to:

- Set state machine inputs
- Fire triggers
- Handle events
- Bind ViewModels

### C++

Using C++, you typically:

- Reference a URiveFile asset
- Create and initialize a URiveArtboard
- Advance the state machine during tick
- Render the Artboard using a render target

C++ provides the most control and is recommended for advanced or performance-critical use cases.

## Use State Machines

If your Rive file includes a state machine, you can:

- Set boolean and number inputs
- Fire trigger inputs
- Handle pointer interaction
- Receive reported events

State machines are accessed and updated through the Artboard.

## Use ViewModels

If your file defines ViewModels, you can:

- Create a ViewModel instance
- Set typed properties (boolean, number, string, enum, color)
- Bind the ViewModel to an Artboard
- Respond to value changes

ViewModels are the preferred way to bind runtime data to Rive content.
