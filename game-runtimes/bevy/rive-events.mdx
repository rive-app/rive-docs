    With Rive events, you have the ability to subscribe to meaningful signals that get reported from animations, state machines, and Rive listeners, all created at design time from the Rive editor.

    Events are a way to send signals to your runtime code to execute a block of code at the right moment.

## Subscribing to Events

Imports needed:

```rust
use rive_bevy::{GenericEvent, RivePlugin, SceneTarget, SpriteEntity, StateMachine};
use rive_rs::state_machine::Property;
```

The following code demonstrates a system listening to all Rive events reported from active state machines.

For example, let's take a look at a code snippet for a star-rating Rive file. If a reported event's name is **star,** the **Number** property is retrieved from the event data.

```rust
fn receive_rive_events_system(mut rive_event: EventReader<GenericEvent>) {
    for event in rive_event.read() {
        info!("Rive event: {:?}", event);
        // We can match on the event name and extract the properties.
        if event.name == "Star" {
            // Find the "rating" property which is a Property::Number.
            if let Some(Property::Number(rating)) = event.properties.get("rating") {
                info!("Rating: {:?}", rating);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Other properties that can be read are **Bool** and **String**, with `Property::Bool` and `Property::String`.
