<Note>
 The rive-unreal package is currently in **Technical Preview** for macOS and Windows. It currently supports **Unreal v5.3 and above.**
</Note>

## Build requirements 

Specific platform dependencies and build tools are needed to compile the Rive plugin.

<Note>
 These steps are only a temporary requirement before the plugin is distributed through **Unreal's Marketplace**.
</Note>

### Unreal Version

- Install *UE 5.3.2 or above* - [Epic Games Launcher.](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download)
- Ensure that *5.3.2 or above* is set as the current version:

- Ensure **Engine Source** is checked from the **Options** launcher shown above:

<Note>
 Work is underway to support newer (and older) versions of Unreal. If you require a specific version of Unreal to be supported, please reach out to us on our [support channel](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).
</Note>

### macOS

The plugin should work on M-Series chips and Intel. *Please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues) if you're encountering difficulties and share you environment details.*

**Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step>[Install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for macOS.</Step>
</Steps>

### Windows

<Note>
 At the moment Rive-Unreal only supports DX11 on Windows. Work for direct RHI integration, DX12, and Vulkan is in progress.
</Note>

**Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step>[Install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for Windows.</Step>
  <Step>Follow [these instructions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3) for setting up Visual Studio for Unreal development.</Step>
  <Step>
    Ensure your project [RHI is set to DirectX 11:](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/aqV9/render-hardware-interface-rhi)
    ![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/67796611-16cd-43f6-ae84-1990a793dcb0/)
  </Step>
</Steps>
**Debug steps**:

Follow these additional steps if you're encountering issues building.

- For the **Visual Studio Installer** within the **Game development with C++** section, be sure to also check:
  - Unreal Engine installer
  - Unreal Engine Test Adapter
  - Unreal Engine uproject support (Preview)
- Ensure Visual Studio and toolchains are updated to the latest versions.
- Ensure you're using a supported version of MSVC. You may run into Windows Toolchain issues, for example:

<Note>
 *"UnrealBuildTool has banned the MSVC 14.39.33519-14.39.99999 toolchains due to compiler issues. Please install a different toolchain such as 14.38.33130 by opening the generated solution and installing recommended components or from the Visual Studio installer.*
</Note>
## Example projects

To quickly experiment with rive-unreal, take a look at our [example project](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal-examples). This sample project demonstrates various Rive features and ways to render Rive content. The blueprint code provides additional instructions and comments on using Rive-Unreal.

**Follow these steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step>Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above.</Step>
  <Step>Download the latest project from the Github [releases tab](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/releases) (named **rive-unreal-examples.zip**).</Step>
  <Step>Extract the project and run **RiveExamples.uproject.**</Step>
  <Step>
    Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **yes.**
    ![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/4cf3df6f-9ce6-47d5-8368-8c51f3c7d995/)
  </Step>
  <Step>It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.</Step>
  <Step>Play the **DemoRoom** game (`/Content/Rive/DemoRoom.umap`).</Step>
</Steps>

**Debug steps**:

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Add Rive to an existing project 

<Note>
 We plan to distribute the Rive Unreal plugin as a free asset on the Unreal Marketplace. Until then, the following steps are needed to add Rive to an existing project.
</Note>

**Steps:**

<Steps>
  <Step>Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above. Shut down the Unreal Editor if it is open.</Step>
  <Step>Download the latest version of the plugin from the Github [releases tab](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/releases) (named **rive-unreal.zip**)</Step>
  <Step>Extract the zip and copy the content to your Unreal project in the file system folder `Your-Project-Name/Plugins/Rive/`</Step>
  <Step>Open your project *.uproject* file.</Step>
  <Step>Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **yes.**</Step>
  <Step>It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.</Step>
  <Step>
    Once the project is open, ensure that the Rive plugin is enabled: **Settings-&gt;Plugins** and search for **Rive.**
    ![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/1e6d9667-d43b-4948-abd1-7735c25cbecb/)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now you can add Rive content!

**Debug steps**:  

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- For Windows, ensure the RHI is set to **DirectX 11.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Adding a Rive file to Unreal

See our documentation on [Exporting](../../editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime) real-time content.

Once you have a `.riv` file, you can simply drag it into the Unreal asset panel, which will automatically create a **RiveFile** object, a **Material**, and a **Widget Blueprint**. On our [Community Page](https://rive.app/community/files/), you can find Rive content that can be remixed and used in your project.
