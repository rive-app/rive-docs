description: "Adding Rive to your Unreal project."
---

<Warning>
  We’re rewriting our Unreal Engine integration to deliver significantly better performance, and it’s already showing a 4x speed boost. To focus on this effort, we’re temporarily pausing support and no longer recommending the current version of the Rive Unreal plugin, which was released as an experimental preview. More details [here](https://community.rive.app/c/announcements/rive-x-unreal).
</Warning>

<Note>
  The rive-unreal package is currently in **Alpha** for macOS and Windows. It currently supports **Unreal 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5.**
</Note>

<Tip>
  Helpful hint: To avoid issues with compiling the Rive modules, it's best to either:

  1. Create a C\+\+ project instead of a Blueprint project, OR
  2. Immediately add a C\+\+ class to the project after creation (and BEFORE adding the Rive plugin).
</Tip>

## Build requirements

Specific platform dependencies and build tools are needed to compile the Rive plugin.

<Note>
  These steps are only a temporary requirement before the plugin is distributed through **Fab**.
</Note>

### Unreal Version

- Install _UE 5.3.2 or above_ - [Epic Games Launcher.](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download)
- Ensure that _5.3.2 or above_ is set as the current version:![Image](/images/game-runtimes/unreal/c75a2b18-7208-4b28-bfef-a998a9a0bf08.webp)
- Ensure **Engine Source** is checked from the **Options** launcher shown above:![Image](/images/game-runtimes/unreal/50bf5981-f34a-43cd-b149-09a84bb8b49b.webp)

<Note>
  Work is underway to support newer (and older) versions of Unreal. If you require a specific version of Unreal to be supported, please reach out to us on our [support channel](https://community.rive.app/c/support/).
</Note>

### MacOS

The plugin is designed to work on both M-Series chips and Intel. _Please_ [file an issue on Github](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues) _if you're encountering difficulties and share you environment details._

**Steps:**

- [Install XCode ](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)for MacOS.

### Windows

**Steps:**

1. [Install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for Windows.
2. Follow [these instructions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3) for setting up Visual Studio for Unreal development.

**Debug steps**:

Follow these additional steps if you're encountering issues building.

- For the **Visual Studio Installer** within the **Game development with C\+\+** section, be sure to also check:
  - Unreal Engine installer
  - Unreal Engine Test Adapter
  - Unreal Engine uproject support (Preview)
- Ensure Visual Studio and toolchains are updated to the latest versions.
- Ensure you're using a supported version of MSVC. You may run into Windows Toolchain issues, for example:

<Note>
  _"UnrealBuildTool has banned the MSVC 14.39.33519-14.39.99999 toolchains due to compiler issues. Please install a different toolchain such as 14.38.33130 by opening the generated solution and installing recommended components or from the Visual Studio installer._
</Note>

## Demo Project

To quickly experiment with rive-unreal, take a look at our [demos project](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal-demos). This sample project demonstrates various Rive features and ways to render Rive content. The blueprint code provides additional instructions and comments on using Rive in Unreal.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above.
2. Download the latest project from the Github.
3. Extract the project and run **ShowDemo.uproject.**
4. Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **yes.** Note that the names of the modules may differ from the image below. ![Image](/images/game-runtimes/unreal/4cf3df6f-9ce6-47d5-8368-8c51f3c7d995.webp)
5. It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.
6. Play the **MainMenu** level (`/Content/Levels/MainMenu/LV_MainMenu.umap`).

**Debug steps**:

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Add Rive to an existing project

<Note>
  We plan to distribute the Rive Unreal plugin as a free asset on Fab. Until then, the following steps are needed to add Rive to an existing project.
</Note>

**Steps:**

1. Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above. Shut down the Unreal Editor if it is open.
2. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Github [releases tab](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/releases) (named with a version number like **Rive-X.Y.Z.zip**)
3. Extract the zip and copy the content to your Unreal project in the file system folder `Your-Project-Name/Plugins/Rive/`
4. Open your project _.uproject_ file.
5. Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **Yes.**
6. It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.
7. Once the project is open, ensure that the Rive plugin is enabled: **Settings-\>Plugins** and search for **Rive.**![Image](/images/game-runtimes/unreal/1e6d9667-d43b-4948-abd1-7735c25cbecb.webp)

Now you can add Rive content\!

**Debug steps**:

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- For Windows, ensure the RHI is set to **DirectX 11.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Adding a Rive file to Unreal

See our documentation on [Exporting](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime) real-time content.

Once you have a `.riv` file, you can simply drag it into the Unreal Content Browser, which will automatically create a **RiveFile** object, a **RiveTextureObject**, and a **Widget Blueprint**. On our [Marketplace](https://rive.app/marketplace), you can find Rive content that can be remixed and used in your project. 

See the following sections on using the **RiveFile** object.
