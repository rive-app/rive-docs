description: "Adding Rive to your Unreal project."
---

<Note>
  The rive-unreal package is currently in **Alpha** for macOS and Windows. It currently supports **Unreal 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.**
</Note>

<Tip>
  Helpful hint: To avoid issues with compiling the Rive modules, it's best to either:

  1. Create a C\+\+ project instead of a Blueprint project, OR
  2. Immediately add a C\+\+ class to the project after creation (and BEFORE adding the Rive plugin).
</Tip>

## Build requirements

Specific platform dependencies and build tools are needed to compile the Rive plugin.

<Note>
  These steps are only a temporary requirement before the plugin is distributed through **Fab**.
</Note>

### Unreal Version

- Install _UE 5.3.2 or above_ - [Epic Games Launcher.](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download)
- Ensure that _5.3.2 or above_ is set as the current version:![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/c75a2b18-7208-4b28-bfef-a998a9a0bf08/)
- Ensure **Engine Source** is checked from the **Options** launcher shown above:![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/50bf5981-f34a-43cd-b149-09a84bb8b49b/)

<Note>
  Work is underway to support newer (and older) versions of Unreal. If you require a specific version of Unreal to be supported, please reach out to us on our [support channel](https://rive.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).
</Note>

### MacOS

The plugin should work on M-Series chips and Intel. _Please_ [file an issue on Github](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues) _if you're encountering difficulties and share you environment details._

**Steps:**

- [Install XCode ](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)for MacOS.

### Windows

<Note>
  At the moment Rive-Unreal supports DX11 and DX12 on Windows. Vulkan support is in progress.
</Note>

**Steps:**

1. [Install Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for Windows.
2. Follow [these instructions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3) for setting up Visual Studio for Unreal development.

**Debug steps**:

Follow these additional steps if you're encountering issues building.

- For the **Visual Studio Installer** within the **Game development with C\+\+** section, be sure to also check:
  - Unreal Engine installer
  - Unreal Engine Test Adapter
  - Unreal Engine uproject support (Preview)
- Ensure Visual Studio and toolchains are updated to the latest versions.
- Ensure you're using a supported version of MSVC. You may run into Windows Toolchain issues, for example:

<Note>
  _"UnrealBuildTool has banned the MSVC 14.39.33519-14.39.99999 toolchains due to compiler issues. Please install a different toolchain such as 14.38.33130 by opening the generated solution and installing recommended components or from the Visual Studio installer._
</Note>

## Demo Project

To quickly experiment with rive-unreal, take a look at our [demos project](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal-demos). This sample project demonstrates various Rive features and ways to render Rive content. The blueprint code provides additional instructions and comments on using Rive in Unreal.

**Follow these steps:**

1. Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above.
2. Download the latest project from the Github.
3. Extract the project and run **ShowDemo.uproject.**
4. Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **yes.** Note that the names of the modules may differ from the image below. ![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/4cf3df6f-9ce6-47d5-8368-8c51f3c7d995/)
5. It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.
6. Play the **MainMenu** level (`/Content/Levels/MainMenu/LV_MainMenu.umap`).

**Debug steps**:

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Add Rive to an existing project

<Note>
  We plan to distribute the Rive Unreal plugin as a free asset on Fab. Until then, the following steps are needed to add Rive to an existing project.
</Note>

**Steps:**

1. Ensure you've completed the steps outlined in **Build requirements** above. Shut down the Unreal Editor if it is open.
2. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Github [releases tab](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/releases) (named with a version number like **Rive-X.Y.Z.zip**)
3. Extract the zip and copy the content to your Unreal project in the file system folder `Your-Project-Name/Plugins/Rive/`
4. Open your project _.uproject_ file.
5. Wait a bit until a popup appears, asking to build missing modules. Select **yes.**
6. It may take a while to open the project the first time and appear as if nothing is happening. It shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.
7. Once the project is open, ensure that the Rive plugin is enabled: **Settings-\>Plugins** and search for **Rive.**![Image](https://ucarecdn.com/1e6d9667-d43b-4948-abd1-7735c25cbecb/)

Now you can add Rive content\!

**Debug steps**:

- See the debug steps in **Build requirements.**
- For Windows, ensure the RHI is set to **DirectX 11.**
- If you encounter difficulties compiling, please [report the issue on our Github.](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-unreal/issues)

## Adding a Rive file to Unreal

See our documentation on [Exporting](../../editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime) real-time content.

Once you have a `.riv` file, you can simply drag it into the Unreal asset panel, which will automatically create a **RiveFile** object, a Rive**TextureObject**, and a **Widget Blueprint**. On our [Marketplace](https://rive.app/marketplace), you can find Rive content that can be remixed and used in your project. 

See the following sections on using the **RiveFile** object.
