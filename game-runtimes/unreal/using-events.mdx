# Triggering Events

In the Unreal runtime, "events" should be modeled as **ViewModel Trigger Properties**.

Fire and observe triggers through the **ViewModel Instance**.

<Info>
  Use **Trigger Properties** for one-shot actions (clicks, milestones, transitions).
</Info>

## Recommended Flow

1. Define a **Trigger Property** in your Rive ViewModel (for example `OnClick`).
2. In Unreal, create and bind a **ViewModel Instance** to your Rive widget or artboard.
3. Fire the trigger from Blueprint using **Call {TriggerName}**.
4. Respond to the trigger in Blueprint using **Bind Event to {TriggerName}**.

## Blueprint Setup

1. Create a Rive widget from your imported `.riv` file.
2. Create a **ViewModel Instance** using **Make View Model**.
3. Assign that instance to the widget/artboard.
4. Keep a reference to the bound ViewModel instance.

<Tip>
  Keep ViewModel creation and delegate binding in the same owning Blueprint so lifetime is clear.
</Tip>

## Firing a Trigger in Blueprint

When you want to fire an event (button press, gameplay action, etc.), call the trigger function exposed on the bound ViewModel instance.

Typical pattern:

1. Get your bound ViewModel instance reference.
2. Call **Call {TriggerName}** (for example `Call OnClick`).
3. Pass any required inputs for the generated function signature.

The trigger is consumed during the next artboard tick and resets automatically.

## Observing Trigger Results

If Unreal needs to react when the trigger is fired:

- Use **Bind Event to {TriggerName}** on the ViewModel instance.
- Handle callbacks synchronously during the update cycle.
- Unbind delegates before destroying the ViewModel instance.

## Common Patterns

- UI button pressed -> `Call OnClick` + `Bind Event to OnClick`
- Transition notification -> `Call OnTransition` + `Bind Event to OnTransition`
- One-shot gameplay signal -> `Call OnAction` + `Bind Event to OnAction`

Use bool/number/enum/string/color fields for persistent state, not triggers.

## Troubleshooting

- Trigger appears to do nothing:
  - Confirm the ViewModel instance is bound to the active widget/artboard.
  - Confirm the trigger name matches the ViewModel field in the `.riv`.
  - Confirm the artboard is ticking.
- Callback does not fire:
  - Confirm the delegate is bound to the correct field.
  - Confirm bindings are still valid after artboard reinitialization.
