See the [runtime documentation](https://rive.app/community/doc/loading-assets/doct4wVHGPgC) for more information on loading assets out-of-band.

<Note>
 Only **embedded** and **referenced** assets are supported in Rive Unreal; **hosted** assets are not currently supported.

<Note>
 Only **png** image assets are supported. Support for **webp** and **jpeg** is in progress.

## Asset export options

Within the Rive Editor, you can select an asset (for example, an image or font) in the **Asset Panel** and configure the export option for that asset. A Rive file can have a mixture of **embedded**, **referenced**, and **hosted** assets.

**Embedded** assets are included with the exported `.riv` binary file, while **referenced** assets are packaged separately and must be linked at runtime. Using **referenced** assets enables you to reuse the same asset across multiple Rive files. This reduces the size of your `.riv` file and the resources needed to run your animations that use a shared asset.

### Embedded Assets

Any asset marked as embedded will be included as part of the `riv` binary file and automatically loaded. You do not need to do anything to configure the asset in Unreal.

### Referenced Assets 

Referenced assets need to be linked at runtime. The rive-unreal package automatically handles the linking.

When you import a Rive file, the plugin scans the disk to load in any referenced asset that matches the correct **Name** + **ID** combination, automatically include them, store them "raw" inside of Unreal as a special asset, and link them. In this way, multiple `riv` files can reuse the same underlying assets (fonts, images, and audio).

**Let's take a look at an example**

Below is an extracted Rive file. The filename is `rive_1.riv` and it uses a referenced font `inter-594377.ttf`.

Here is another Rive file, named `rive_2.riv` which uses the same font.

To start, drag `rive_1.riv` into Unreal:

<Warning>
 Only drag in the `riv` file. Not the assets.<br/>
 The assets will automatically be imported from disk.
</Warning>

The referenced asset is imported as a `RiveAsset` and the `RiveFile` can be used as normal.

Next, drag in `rive_2.riv`:

Now we have two `RiveFile` assets that point to the same font asset.

If a matching asset is not found when importing in Unreal (**Name** + **ID**), there is a fallback to converting and linking a file that matches only the **name**. You can optionally use this approach to have more control over asset importing, as an asset filename can be renamed in the Rive Editor.
