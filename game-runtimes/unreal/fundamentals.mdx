## Adding Rive files 

To add a `.riv` file to an Unreal project, simply drag it into Unreal's Content Browser. Once dropped, a **Rive File**, **Rive Texture Object**, and **Widget Blueprint** asset will be automatically created. A **RiveFile** is a wrapper component configuring the Rive graphic to display, using a backing `.riv` file's data. It contains the following properties:

- **Artboard name**: The [artboard](https://rive.app/community/doc/artboards/docYyi4AbIjL) to load.
- **State machine name**: The [state machine](https://rive.app/community/doc/state-machines/docxeznG7iiK) to play.
- **Rive fit type**: How the graphic should fit in the available sizes (see [Fit](https://rive.app/community/doc/layout/docBl81zd1GB)).
- **Size**: The size of the underlying render target to which the graphic is drawn. The default value is equal to the artboard size, as set in the Rive editor.
- Other texture properties.

An important concept to understand is that the **RiveFile** contains the underlying **artboard** and **state machine** that the Rive runtime uses. 

You can view the details of a **RiveFile** by double-clicking on it in the content browser and examining the Details pane. You can see all of the **artboards**, **state machines, triggers** and **inputs** included in the file.

## RiveTextureObjects 

While a **RiveFile** contains the data of a Rive asset, it is the **RiveTextureObject** that handles running the animations and handling state machines. Every **RiveTextureObject** runs independently, even if created from the same **RiveFile**. When you double-click on a **RiveTextureObject** you can examine and change various values associated with that object:

Leaving the Artboard name or State Machine name blank will use the default values.

<Note>
 Note that the **size** attribute determines the width and height of the underlying render texture. A larger size improves the quality but increases the memory usage.

## Create Rive Widget, Create Rive Texture Object, and Reimport

Right-click a **RiveFile** to access common actions:

Selecting **"Spawn Rive Widget Actor"** will create an Actor in your Level. Playing the Level will display the Rive file as a UMG Widget. Alternatively, you can spawn a widget actor by dragging and dropping the **RiveFile** asset into the level. Note that the location of the actor in the scene does not affect it's display.

If you need more than the default **Rive Widget** or **Rive Texture Object**, you can create them from this menu.
You can also **Reimport** your Rive file to get updates made to the file outside of Unreal.

## Create a material asset 

You can easily create a material asset from a **RiveTextureObject**:

- **Right-click** and select **"Create Material"**

The created material asset uses the selected **RiveTextureObject** as a texture.

### Displaying

This material can be added to a 3D mesh to be rendered in the scene, just like any other material.

## Adding Rive to UMG

You can easily create a Widget Blueprint from a **RiveFile**:

- **Right click** the **RiveFile** and select **"Create Rive Widget"**

This will automatically create a Widget Blueprint using the selected **RiveFile**.

Alternatively, a **Rive Widget** can be added from the **UMG** **Palette** and then selecting the underlying **RiveFile** to use as a reference. This is done in the "Rive Descriptor" section in the Details pane. Leaving the Artboard name or State Machine Name blank will cause defaults in the file to be used.

<Note>
 Be sure to click **Compile** to make the graphic visible.

<Note>
 Listeners (pointer events) are disabled in this view. This means the Rive graphic is not interactive within UMG.

### Accessing RiveWidget in Blueprint 

The **RiveWidget** can be accessed through Blueprint, if the **Is Variable** toggle is set (default is checked).

### Displaying 

Once a Widget Blueprint is configured, you only need to add it to the Viewport. In this example we're creating a new Actor and adding the following.

Once the actor is added to the game and you enter play mode the animation will function exactly as it does in the Rive Editor.

See the following sections for more advanced usage.

## Instancing a RiveTextureObject 

If, for example, your `.riv` file contains multiple different artboards, or if you want to create unique instances of the same artboard and state machine combination, you can easily do so by instancing new **RiveTextureObject**s through the editor:

- **Right-click** a **RiveTextureObject** and select **"Duplicate"**

These new instances use the same underlying `.riv` file data; however they are unique instances and can be configured with the available properties, such as artboard, state machine, size, etc. Each **RiveTextureObject** instance contains a unique **artboard** and **state machine** instance that can be updated and used independently.

An artboard and state machine can be instanced manually through Blueprint as well. Later sections will demonstrate how to do this.
