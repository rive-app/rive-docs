For more information on Rive State Machines see the respective [runtime](/runtimes/state-machines) and [editor](/editor/state-machine/) documentation.

## Overview

To select a state machine, double-click the **RiveTextureObject** asset and enter a state machine name. Leaving the name blank will use the default state machine.

<Note>
 A Rive file may contain many artboards, and an artboard may contain many state machines.
</Note>
## Setting Inputs

A Rive state machine can have the following input types:

- a **boolean** that can be set to true or false.
- a **number** that can be set to any value.
- a **trigger** that is a boolean set to true for one frame.

The available inputs can be viewed in the Rive Editor when selecting a state machine, for example:

In the example above:`effectsVolume` is a **number**, `continueAvailable` is a **boolean**, and `back` is a **trigger**.

<Note>
 An **Input** is accessed by its string name from an **Artboard** (retrieved from a **RiveFile)**.
</Note>
### Boolean Input

To update a boolean value call `Set Bool Value` on the artboard.

In the example below, we're setting the boolean input, named `isOpen`, equal to a local variable `Is Open`.

To read a boolean value call `Get Bool Value` on the artboard, and get the return value.

### Number Input

To update a number value call `Set Number Value` on the artboard.

In the example below, we're setting the number input, named `health`, equal to a local variable `Health`.

### Trigger Input

To fire a trigger, call `Fire Trigger` on the artboard.

In the example below, we're firing the trigger named `openMenu`.

### Nested Inputs

You can call these functions on nested inputs by using the node equivalents that end in "at Path". See the [Nested Artboards](/editor/fundamentals/nested-artboards) documentation for more details on using nested artboards.

## Example

Let's take a look at an example. The video below shows a Rive file with a simple state machine containing one number input, named `numExpression`.

></video>

This number input switches out the active playing animation, and the state machine blends between the different animations as they transition.

From a runtime  we can set the `numExpression` through Blueprint to toggle the correct expression for the Robot.

></video>

In this example, the number input is set when the corresponding number key is pressed:
