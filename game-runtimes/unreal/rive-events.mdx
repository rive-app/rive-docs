For more information on Rive Events see the respective [runtime](/runtimes/rive-events) and [editor](/editor/events/) documentation.

## Overview 

Rive Events provides a way to communicate information from the graphic to your runtime code, such as a button press. An event can contain any number of the following properties: **boolean**, **number**, or **string**.

## Accessing Events 

To access a Rive event, bind the **Event** **Name** to a **Custom Event** from the **Artboard**. In this example, the `CustomRiveEvent` will fire each time an event named `Rating` is reported.

<Note>
 An **Event** is accessed by its string name from an **Artboard** (retrieved from a **RiveFile)**.
</Note>
The function `Print to Texts` takes the **Rive Event** and loops over all of the event's properties.

## Example

Let's take a look at an example. The video below demonstrates a Rive file using the "Star Rating" example. This example reports an event each time one of the stars are pressed. The event is named `Rating` and contains a **number** property named `value` that matches the pressed star.

In Blueprint, we:

1. **Bind Named Rive Event**: `Rating`
2. Break the **RiveEvent**, and loop over the **number** properties
3. Break each **RiveEventNumberProperty**
4. Find the **number** property named `value`
5. Print the value of the **number** property
