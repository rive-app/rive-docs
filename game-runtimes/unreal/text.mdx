## Update Rive Text in Unreal

A text run can be updated from an artboard instance by providing the text run **name** and **new value**:

In the example above, we set the **text run** with name `username` equal to "Gordon".

<Note>
 A unique text run name must be set in the editor to be discoverable at runtime. See the text runtime docs for more information.
</Note>

This Artboard contains a **text** **run** with name `username`. A unique name makes it discoverable at runtime.

Use the **SetTextValueAtPath** node to set a **text run** located in a nested artboard.
