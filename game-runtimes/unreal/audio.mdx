Depending on how you use Rive in Unreal, there may be additional setup required to enable audio in a Rive asset.

- When dragging a **RiveFile** into your level from the Content Browser, a **RiveAudioEngine** component will be automatically created and assigned to the **RiveWidgetActor**. *No further setup is required.*
- When adding a **RiveActor** component to a custom **Actor** blueprint, you will need to add a **RiveAudioEngine** component. The **RiveActor** will automatically detect and use this audio engine.
- If you use **RiveTextureObject** or **RiveWidget** directly, you need to associate an audio engine with them by calling **SetAudioEngine** in the **OnRiveReady** event. The following example shows how to do this with a dynamically created **RiveWidget.**
