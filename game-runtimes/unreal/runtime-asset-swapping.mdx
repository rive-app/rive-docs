title: "Runtime Asset Swapping"
description: "Load referenced image and font assets at runtime in Unreal."

## Overview

Referenced assets are represented by Unreal objects, and you load data directly onto those objects:

- `URiveImageAsset`
- `URiveFontAsset`

## How Asset Loading Works

When a `.riv` contains referenced assets:

- The plugin tracks them by **asset ID**.
- Referenced assets are created as Unreal assets alongside your imported `URiveFile`.
- The runtime decodes and applies bytes through typed asset classes.

For image/font replacements at runtime, use the asset objects directly:

- Images: `LoadTexture(UTexture2D*)` or `LoadImageBytes(const TArray<uint8>&)`
- Fonts: `LoadFontFace(UFontFace*)` or `LoadFontBytes(const TArray<uint8>&)`

## Recommended Workflow

1. In the Rive Editor, set assets to **Referenced** if you want to supply them outside the `.riv`.
2. Import the `.riv` into Unreal.
3. Locate generated referenced assets in Content Browser (typically named like `AssetName-AssetId`).
4. In Blueprint or C++, hold references to those `URiveImageAsset` / `URiveFontAsset` objects.
5. Before or during playback, call the load function that matches your source data.

## Blueprint Runtime Replacement

Use object references to your Rive asset objects and call:

- `Load Texture` on `RiveImageAsset` for a `Texture2D`
- `Load Image Bytes` on `RiveImageAsset` for raw encoded image bytes
- `Load Font Face` on `RiveFontAsset` for a `Font Face`
- `Load Font Bytes` on `RiveFontAsset` for raw font bytes

After loading, continue rendering with your `RiveFile`/`RiveArtboard` normally.

## C++ API Surface

Use these headers:

```cpp
#include "Rive/Assets/RiveImageAsset.h"
#include "Rive/Assets/RiveFontAsset.h"
```

Runtime-loading functions:

```cpp
URiveImageAsset::LoadTexture(UTexture2D* InTexture);
URiveImageAsset::LoadImageBytes(const TArray<uint8>& InBytes);

URiveFontAsset::LoadFontFace(UFontFace* InFont);
URiveFontAsset::LoadFontBytes(const TArray<uint8>& InBytes);
```

## Important Notes

- Referenced asset resolution is ID-based inside the plugin.
- If your project uses image data binding for dynamic visuals, prefer that path for per-instance image changes.

## Troubleshooting

- If a referenced asset does not update, confirm you are editing the correct generated Rive asset object (`AssetName-AssetId`).
- If bytes-based loading fails, validate file format and byte contents (supported image/font formats only).
- Reimporting the `.riv` can regenerate/update metadata; re-check referenced asset objects after reimport.
