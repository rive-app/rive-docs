Rive allows you to swap font and image assets at runtime. How you swap the asset depends on the type of asset and where it is located.

## Using Rive Assets 

In order to swap an asset, you must first locate it in the **Rive File**. This is done using the **Get Rive Asset By Name** node. The name used for searching is the name of the asset as it appears in the **Assets** section of the Rive editor.

If the Rive asset is located, you then cast the return value to the type of the asset, either a **RiveFontAsset** or **RiveImageAsset**.

Once cast to to the correct asset type, you load a value into the asset. Different asset types use different nodes to load data.

## Image Assets

Image assets can be loaded by **Texture** or by an array of bytes. The **Load Texture** node is used to load a Texture that resides in your Unreal project.

<Note>
 The texture to be loaded with a Load Texture node must have its **Mip Gen Settings** set to **NoMipMaps** and its **Compression Settings** set to **UserInterface2d (RGBA)**.

Image assets can also be loaded as an array of bytes in **png**, **webp**, or **jpg** format. This is useful if you want to load an image from a CDN, a raw file, or a location on the internet. It is up to the developer to provide the image as an array of bytes.

## Font Assets 

Font assets can be loaded as either a **Font Face** located in your Unreal project, or an array of bytes in **otf** or **ttf** format.
