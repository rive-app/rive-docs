<Warning>
  We’re rewriting our Unreal Engine integration to deliver significantly better performance, and it’s already showing a 4x speed boost. To focus on this effort, we’re temporarily pausing support and no longer recommending the current version of the Rive Unreal plugin, which was released as an experimental preview. More details [here](https://community.rive.app/c/announcements/rive-x-unreal).\
  \
  This page is being left up for those using the legacy version of the plugin.
</Warning>

<Note>
  See '**Feature Support**' below for an updated list of Rive features in Unreal.
