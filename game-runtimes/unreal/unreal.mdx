Rive’s Unreal runtime allows you to render and control Rive animations natively inside Unreal Engine.

It integrates directly with Unreal’s object system and rendering pipeline and is designed for real-time use cases.

<Info>
  The Unreal runtime is C++-first. Blueprint support is provided for reactive logic and UI workflows.

## Supported Unreal Versions

- Unreal Engine 5.7.3 and above

Earlier versions are not supported.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows
- macOS

<Warning>
  Mobile platform support is planned but not yet available.
</Warning>

## Rendering Backends

Depending on platform and engine configuration, supported backends include:

- DirectX (Windows)
- Metal (macOS)

Rendering is handled by Rive’s native renderer and coordinated with Unreal’s render thread.

## Feature Support

| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Animation playback          | ✅          |
| State machines              | ✅          |
| ViewModels (data binding)   | ✅          |
| Property observation        | ✅          |
| Text rendering              | ✅          |
| Image assets                | ✅          |
| Multiple Artboards per file | ✅          |
| Scripting                   | ✅          |
| Legacy state machine events | Deprecated |
| Legacy direct inputs        | Deprecated |

<Warning>
  Legacy state machine events and inputs are deprecated.\
  New integrations should use ViewModels for both input and output.
</Warning>

## Architecture Overview

The Unreal runtime is built around three core runtime objects:

- **Rive File** — Unreal asset containing imported Rive data
- **Artboard** — Runtime instance responsible for evaluation and rendering
- **ViewModel** — Typed data boundary between Unreal and Rive logic

The typical data flow is:

Unreal → ViewModel → State Machine → ViewModel → Unreal

State machines consume and modify ViewModel properties. Unreal observes those changes.
