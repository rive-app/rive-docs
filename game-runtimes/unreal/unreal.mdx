description: Use Rive animations and interactive graphics natively in Unreal Engine.
---

Rive’s Unreal Engine runtime allows you to render and control Rive animations natively in Unreal, with full support for state machines, events, and data binding through ViewModels.

This runtime is designed for **real-time use cases** and integrates directly with Unreal’s rendering and object systems. APIs are **C++-first**, with Blueprint support provided for common workflows.

## Supported Unreal Versions

- Unreal Engine 5.7.1
- Earlier versions may work but are not officially supported

## Supported Target Platforms
