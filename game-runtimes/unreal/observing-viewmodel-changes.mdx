# Observing ViewModel Changes

In the Unreal runtime, **ViewModels** are the supported way for Rive content to communicate back to Unreal.

Legacy **State Machine** events and direct callback mechanisms are deprecated.\
New integrations should observe **ViewModel** property changes instead.

<Info>
  All runtime output from Rive should flow through a **ViewModel Instance**.
</Info>

## How Observation Works

During the **Artboard** tick:

1. Unreal sets **ViewModel** values
2. The **State Machine** evaluates transitions
3. The **State Machine** may modify **ViewModel** values
4. Property change callbacks are emitted
5. Rendering occurs

Observation happens synchronously during this update cycle.

## Registering Callbacks

Each property on a **ViewModel Instance** can be observed.

When a property changes:

- The callback is invoked
- The updated value is available
- Logic can react immediately

Callbacks should be:

- Registered after creating the **ViewModel Instance**
- Unregistered before destroying the instance
- Owned by the same system that owns the instance

  You can use the **Add Field Value Changed Delegate** to trigger events when a value is changed.

  </Frame>

<Tip>
  Use **Trigger Properties** for actions.\
  Use boolean or numeric properties for persistent state.
</Tip>

## Observing Structured Data

Because **ViewModels** may contain nested structures:

- Nested **ViewModel Instances** can also be observed
- Changes propagate through the same callback mechanism
- Observation remains consistent regardless of hierarchy depth

This allows complex UI or gameplay state to remain structured and predictable.

## Lifetime and Safety

Observation follows the lifetime of the **ViewModel Instance**.

Important rules:

- Do not observe destroyed instances
- Unbind callbacks before destroying instances
- Do not assume callbacks persist after **Artboard** reinitialization

Callbacks are synchronous and not asynchronous events.

## Summary

**ViewModels** are both the input and output boundary of the runtime.

Unreal writes values.\
The **State Machine** evaluates.\
