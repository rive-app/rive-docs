For more information on using Rive with Defold, please refer to the [official Defold documentation](https://defold.com/extension-rive/). There, you will find comprehensive guides on setting up Rive graphics and best practices for using them within the Defold engine.

### Rendering

Defold has integrated the [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/renderer) natively, which means that Rive graphics in Defold are rendered by the same renderer used in the Rive Editor. This native integration offers several benefits:

- **Performance**: The Rive Renderer is custom-built for Rive content, for animation, and for runtime. Allowing you to draw an unprecedented amount of vector graphics with mega fast rendering. [Read more](https://rive.app/blog/rive-renderer-now-open-source-and-available-on-all-platforms).
- **Quality**: Graphics remain crisp and clear regardless of scale, resolution, or device.
- **Consistency:** Your graphic will look exactly the same in the Editor and at Runtime.
- **Feature support:** You'll also benefit from upcoming Rive features, such as blurs and shadows, that will only be possible through the Rive Renderer.
