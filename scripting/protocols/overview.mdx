Protocols are the structured categories of scripts that tell the Editor what you’re trying to make.

Rive currently ships with five, with more to come:

- [Node](/scripting/protocols/node-scripts)
- [Layout](/scripting/protocols/layout-scripts)
- [Converter](/scripting/protocols/converter-scripts)
- [Path Effect](/scripting/protocols/path-effect-scripts)
- [Test](/scripting/protocols/test-scripts)

Each protocol represents a different kind of script the Editor can generate: a converter that shapes data, a custom drawing function, a layout helper, a testing harness, a path effect you can attach to strokes, and so on.

Selecting a protocol generates a typed scaffold that defines the surface area you’re allowed to operate on. From there, you work with Rive-native concepts — paths, shapes, view models, artboards, state machines, timelines — but always through the lens of the protocol you picked. It keeps scripts specific and prevents “do anything anywhere” chaos.
