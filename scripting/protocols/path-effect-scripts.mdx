Path Effects are Rive scripts that modify and transform path geometry in real-time. They give you programmatic control over the shape and structure of paths in your animations, enabling effects like warping, distortion, animation, and procedural modifications.


## Creating a Path Effect

[Create a new script](/scripting/creating-scripts) and select **Path Effect** as the type.

## Anatomy of a Path Effect Script

### Methods

- *init (optional)*
Called once when the path effect is created. Use this to set up initial state. Returns true if initialization succeeds.
- *update (required)*
The core method where path transformation happens. Receives the original `PathData` and returns a modified version. This is where you manipulate the path's geometry.
- *advance (optional)*
Called every frame with elapsed time in seconds. Returns true to continue receiving advance calls. Useful for animated effects that change over time.

## Working with `PathData`
`PathData` provides access to a path's drawing commands (`moveTo`, `lineTo`, `cubicTo`, `quadTo`, `close`). You can:

- Read existing commands using indexing
- Get the command count with `#pathData`
- Create new paths and add commands
- Use measurement tools like `contours()` and `measure()` for advanced operations

```lua
type MyPathEffect = {
  context: Context,
}

function init(self: MyPathEffect, context: Context): boolean
  self.context = context
  return true
end

function update(self: MyPathEffect, inPath: PathData): PathData
  local path = Path.new()
  return path
end

function advance(self: MyPathEffect, seconds: number): boolean
  return true
end

-- Return a factory function that Rive uses to build the Path Effect instance.
return function(): PathEffect<MyPathEffect>
  return {
    init = init,
    update = update,
    advance = advance,
    context = late(),
  }
end
```


## Add the Scripted Path Effect to a Stroke

Select or add a stroke to a shape:

1. Open the Options menu.
2. Select the Effects Tab and click the '+' to add an effect.
3. Find your effects under the Script Effects menu option.
4. Any inputs you have defined will apepar and can be edited here.
