TO DO

**Layout** scripts allow you to control layouts...

Layout scripts extend [Node Scripts](/scripting/script-types/node-scripts) and include two additional functions - `resize` and `measure`.

## Examples

- Masonry
- Something simple to explain measure

## Measure

- Only supported with Hug fit type
- optional
- Returns optimal size, but can be overridden by fit rules

```lua
function measure(self: MyLayout): Vec2D
  return Vec2D.xy(100, 100)
end
```

## Resize

- required
- returns the computed size

```lua
-- The `resize` function is called when the Scripting Layout that contains the script is resized.
function resize(self: MyLayout, size: Vec2D)
  print('New size:')
  print('x:', size.x)
  print('y:', size.y)
end
```

## Adding a Layout Script to a Layout

- create a layout, add the script
- add the script, wrap it in a layout
