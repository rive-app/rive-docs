This section introduces the basics of writing and using scripts in Rive. You’ll learn how to create different types of scripts—such as Drawings, Layouts, Converters, and Utils—and how they connect to data bindings and artboards.

If you’re new to programming or to Luau (a modern, type-safe subset of Lua), check out out Luau's  [getting-started guide](https://luau.org/getting-started).

<Note>
  The scripting docs are still a work in progress and we'd love your feedback! If you have recommendations, please click the `Suggest Edits` button at the bottom of each page.
