Rive Scripting with our AI Agent is now in [Early Access](https://rive.app/downloads)! Scripting lets you iterate on code, design, and animation in one collaborative editor.

## Quick Start

This video introduces the basics of writing and using scripts in Rive. You’ll learn how to create different types of scripts and how they connect to data bindings and artboards, and how you can create scripts with the [AI Coding Agent](/scripting/ai-agent).
