This section will cover the basics of attaching scripts to your artboards and using them to control your animations.

## Creating a Script using the Agent

1. Create a new component named `MyComponent` containing a simple shape.
2. Give `MyComponent` a new View Model named `MyComponent`.
3. In the Assets Panel, click the `+` button.
4. Choose **Script** and select a [Drawing Script](/scripting/protocols/drawing-scripts).
5. Attach the script to the **main artboard** by right-clicking the artboard and selecting **Add Script** -> Drawing -> [Your Script Name].
6. Select the script you just created in the Assets Panel to open the editor.
7. Under the `ArtboardDrawing` type definition, add a new input for your component:

```lua
type MyDrawing = {
  -- This input expects an Artboard with a View Model named MyComponent
  myComponent: Input<Artboard<Data.MyComponent>>,
}
```

Additionally, we need to initialize the input with `late()`, so the value can be provided by the editor at runtime.

```lua
return function(): Drawing<MyDrawing>
  return {
    init = init,
    advance = advance,
    update = update,
    draw = draw,
    myComponent = late(),
  }
end
```

8. In the right sidebar of the script group, connect the `myComponent` input to the `MyComponent` component.
9. Open the **Agent panel** from the left sidebar and ask the Agent to render the component to the main artboard.

<Note>
  Querying the agent may require multiple attempts to get a successful action. Prompting the agent to continue attempting the solution may yield better results.
