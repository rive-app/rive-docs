<Note>The AI Coding Agent is available with Cadet, Voyager, and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about our plans and pricing](https://rive.app/pricing).</Note>

The AI Coding Agent helps you write and modify scripts using natural-language prompts.
Ask it to create a script, fix an error, add new functionality, or explain what your code is doing.

## Getting Started

Open the **Agent panel** from the left sidebar and type a prompt describing what you want.

**Example prompt:**

> Create a script that draws a rounded rectangle.
> Width, height, color, and corner radius should be inputs.
> When the inputs change, the drawing should update.

The Agent will respond with:

- A summary of what it changed
- Any new scripts it created
- Explanations for how the script works
- Suggestions for how to customize it

If a new script is generated, you’ll find it in your Assets panel.
