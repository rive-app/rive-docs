<Note>The AI Agent is available Cadet, Voyager, and Enterprise plans. [Learn more about our plans and pricing](https://rive.app/pricing).</Note>

## Getting Started

Open the Agent panel in the left sidebar and type in a  prompt.

**Example prompt:**

> Build a script that draws a rectangle with rounded corners.
> The width, height, color, and corner radius should be inputs.
> When the inputs change, update the drawing.

When it's done, the Agent will tell you exactly what it did and why.

If it created a new script, you should see it in the Assets panel.

## Toolbar

Use the AI Agent toolbar to close, open, and toggle between chats.
