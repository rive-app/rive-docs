title: Vec2D
---

Represents a 2D vector with x and y components.

## Fields

### `x`

Represents a 2D vector with x and y components.
The x-coordinate of the vector.

### `y`

The y-coordinate of the vector.

## Constructors

### `xy`

Creates a vector with the specified x and y components.

### `origin`

Returns the zero vector (0, 0).

### `lerp`

Returns the linear interpolation between the two vectors, using t where
0 returns 'from' and 1 returns 'to'.

## Static Functions

### `distance`

Returns the distance between the two vectors.

### `distanceSquared`

Returns the squared distance between the two vectors.

### `dot`

Returns the dot product of the two vectors.

## Methods

### `length`

Provides indexed access to the vector components.
Returns the length of the vector.

### `lengthSquared`

Returns the squared length of the vector.

### `normalized`

Returns a normalized copy of the vector. If the length is zero,
the result is the zero vector.

### `__eq`

Returns true if the two vectors have equal components.

### `__unm`

Returns the negated vector.

### `__add`

Returns the sum of two vectors.

### `__sub`

Returns the difference between two vectors.

### `__mul`

Returns the vector scaled by the given number.

### `__div`

Returns the vector divided by the given number

### `distance`

Returns the distance to the other vector.

### `distanceSquared`

Returns the squared distance to the other vector.

### `dot`

Returns the dot product of the vector and the other vector.

### `lerp`

Returns the linear interpolation between the vector and the other
vector, using t where 0 returns the vector and 1 returns the other.
