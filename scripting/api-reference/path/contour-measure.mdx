title: ContourMeasure
---

A ContourMeasure is a way to measure and manipulate a single contour within a path.
A contour is one continuous drawing sequence that starts with a `moveTo` and continues until the next `moveTo` (or the end of the path).


## Fields

### `next`

Returns the next [ContourMeasure](/scripting/api-reference/path/contour-measure) in the path, or nil if this is the last
contour. Use this to iterate through all contours in a path after calling
path:contours().
```lua
local contour = pathData:contours()
while contour do
  print(contour.length)
  contour = contour.next
end
```
