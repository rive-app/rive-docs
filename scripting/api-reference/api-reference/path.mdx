## Constructors

### `new`

## Methods

### `moveTo`

Moves the current point to the specified location, starting a new
contour.

### `lineTo`

Adds a straight line segment from the current point to the specified
point.

### `quadTo`

Adds a quadratic Bézier curve from the current point to the specified
point, using the control point to define the curve shape.

### `cubicTo`

Adds a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to the specified point,
using controlOut for the start tangent and controlIn for the end tangent.

### `close`

Closes the current contour by adding a line segment from the current
point back to the first point of the contour (the last moveTo).

### `__len`

### `reset`

Paths should not be reset while they are in flight for rendering. Only
call reset on subsequent frames if you've called Renderer.drawPath with
it.

### `add`

Add one path to another path with the given transform, when specified.

### `contours`

Returns a ContourMeasure for the first contour in the path. A contour is
a sequence of path segments between moveTo operations. Use the 'next'
property on the returned ContourMeasure to iterate through subsequent
contours. Returns nil if the path has no contours.

### `measure`

Returns a PathMeasure that measures the entire path across all contours.
This provides the total length and allows operations on the path as a whole.
