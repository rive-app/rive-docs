title: PathMeasure
---

## Fields

### `length`

The total length of the path across all contours.
```lua
local measure = path:measure()
local pathLength = measure.length
```


### `isClosed`

Returns true only if the path has exactly one contour and that contour is
closed. Paths with multiple contours always return false, even if all
contours are closed.


## Methods

### `positionAndTangent`

Returns the position and tangent vector at the given distance along the
path. The distance is clamped to the valid range [0, length]. Returns two
Vector values: the position and the normalized tangent vector.

### `warp`

Warps a point onto the path. The x-coordinate of the source point is
interpreted as a distance along the path, and the y-coordinate is used as
an offset along the tangent direction. Returns the warped position as a
Vector.

### `extract`

Extracts a sub-section of the path from startDistance to endDistance and
appends it to the destination path. Distances are clamped to the valid
range [0, length]. If startWithMove is true (the default), the extracted
segment begins with a moveTo operation. If false, it continues from the
previous point in the destination path.
