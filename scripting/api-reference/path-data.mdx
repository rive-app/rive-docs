title: PathData
---

PathData is an indexed collection of [PathCommand](/scripting/api-reference/path-command) objects.
Both Path and PathData behave like arrays of commands and support iteration via ipairs.


## Methods

### `__len`

PathData is an indexed collection of `PathCommand` objects.
Both Path and PathData behave like arrays of commands and support iteration via ipairs.
Each entry is a `PathCommand` describing one segment or action in the path.
Returns the number of commands in the path.

### `contours`

Returns a `ContourMeasure` for the first contour in the path. A contour is
a sequence of path segments between moveTo operations. Use the 'next'
property on the returned ContourMeasure to iterate through subsequent
contours. Returns nil if the path has no contours.

### `measure`

Returns a PathMeasure that measures the entire path across all contours.
This provides the total length and allows operations on the path as a whole.
