title: Renderer
---

Provides functions for drawing paths and images, managing clipping, and
applying transforms during rendering.


## Methods

### `drawPath`

```lua
drawPath(path: Path, paint: Paint)
```

Provides functions for drawing paths and images, managing clipping, and
applying transforms during rendering.
Draws the given path using the specified paint.


### `drawImage`

```lua
drawImage(image: Image, sampler: ImageSampler,  blendMode: BlendMode, opacity: number)
```

Draws an image using the specified sampler, blend mode, and opacity.


### `drawImageMesh`

```lua
drawImageMesh(image: Image, sampler: ImageSampler, vertices: VertexBuffer, uvs: VertexBuffer, triangles: TriangleBuffer, blendMode: BlendMode, opacity: number)
```

Draws an image using mesh data defined by vertices, texture
coordinates, and triangle indices.


### `clipPath`

```lua
clipPath(path: Path)
```

Restricts subsequent drawing to the area defined by the given path.
Clipping remains in effect until the next restore call.


### `save`

```lua
save()
```

Saves the current rendering state, including transforms and clipping.


### `restore`

```lua
restore()
```

Restores the most recently saved rendering state.


### `transform`

```lua
transform(transform: Mat2D)
```

Applies a transform to the current rendering state. Transforms are
applied cumulatively until restored.
