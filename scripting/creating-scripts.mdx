New scripts are saved as Assets and can be found in the Assets Panel.
## Adding Scripts to Your Scene

- Right-click the artboard you'd like to add your script to and select your script from the menu
- the script position will affect where it renders
- Select the group to set inputs (See [Script Inputs](/scripting/script-inputs))

**Troubleshooting: If you don't see your script in the list:**

1. Make sure your script is in the Assets Panel.
2. Check the [Problems Panel](/scripting/debugging/debug-panel#problems) for issues.
3. Make sure your script returns a function that returns a table with at least an `init` and `draw` function.

<Tip>
Use **PascalCase** for script name and update the script’s type name accordingly.

Example: If the script is named `MyConverter`, the main type should also be named `MyConverter`.
