The Console shows all log output from your scripts during playback. You can use the standard [Luau print()](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/LuaGlobals#print) function to log information, variable values, and messages.

```lua
print("Rive is so cool!")
print("Elapsed time:", seconds)
```

## Problems

The Problems tab lists problems detected before the script runs — such as type mismatches, syntax errors, or missing data bindings.

The Problems tab handle shows the number of issues found in your scripts.
Click an item in the Problems panel to jump directly to the affected line of code.
Hover over any underlined code in the editor to see more details about the issue.
