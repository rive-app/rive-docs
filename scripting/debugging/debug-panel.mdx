The Debug Panel lets you inspect script output and detect issues
in your code.

## Toolbar

The Debug Panel contains main tabs - [Console](#console) and [Problems](#problems):

Logs appear in real time as the state machine plays.


## Console

The Console shows all log output from your scripts during playback. You can use the standard [Luau print()](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/globals/LuaGlobals#print) function to log information, variable values, and messages.

```lua
print("Rive is so cool!")
print("Elapsed time:", seconds)
```

## Problems

The Problems tab lists problems detected _before_ the script runs such as type mismatches, syntax errors, or missing data bindings.

The tab badge shows the number of issues found across your scripts.

Clicking a problem will jump directly to the affected line of code.
You can also hover any underlined code in the editor to see an explanation or suggested fix.
