Starting in v4 of our React runtimes, Rive will support Rive Text at runtime, which includes the following packages:

- React
  - `@rive-app/react-canvas`
  - `@rive-app/react-webgl`

## Major Changes

<Note>
 No breaking API changes!
</Note>

While a new major version has been released for the runtimes without breaking API changes, v4 was released due to a **bundle** **size increase** in the package from the core Web (JS) runtime dependency. See that migration guide [here](/runtimes/react/migrating-from-v1-to-v3).

In the future, we may introduce a "lite" package without these larger dependencies if you don't need the text feature, but for now, it will remain the default on the main web runtime packages.
