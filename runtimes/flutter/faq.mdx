## Where should I look first when my Flutter build fails?

Start with these docs:

- [Flutter runtime troubleshooting](/runtimes/flutter/flutter#troubleshooting)
- [Rive Native troubleshooting](/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#troubleshooting)
- [Building `rive_native`](/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#building-rive-native)
- [Flutter migration guide](/runtimes/flutter/migration-guide)

Most build issues come from setup/version mismatches, stale native artifacts, or skipped native setup. A clean rebuild usually helps:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you still see Android setup errors, follow the Android notes in [Rive Native troubleshooting](/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#android).

## `LateInitializationError: Field 'makeFlutterFactory' has not been initialized`

If you see an error like `LateInitializationError: Field 'makeFlutterFactory' has not been initialized`, make sure you initialize Rive before showing any Rive widgets.

Call `await RiveNative.init()` early (for example in `main()`), before creating or using `Factory.flutter`/`Factory.rive`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:rive/rive.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await RiveNative.init();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

## How to enable 16KB page support on Android?

Rive Flutter `0.14.x` includes 16KB page support by default.

If you're on `0.13.x`, you need to specify the NDK version used by setting `rive.ndk.version=28.1.13356709` in your `gradle.properties` file.

This gives you 16KB page support and flexibility to control the NDK used for future updates.

For additional context, see [rive-flutter issue #479](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/479).
