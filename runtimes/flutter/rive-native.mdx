[Rive Native](https://pub.dev/packages/rive_native) is a new runtime that enables you to display and interact with Rive graphics in your Flutter app, powered by the [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/renderer).

## Rive Native vs Rive

`rive_native` does not replace the current [Rive Flutter runtime](https://pub.dev/packages/rive) (`rive`). Instead, we are working on integrating `rive_native` into the `rive` package. You can use `rive_native` independently if desired, and the API will remain largely consistent between `rive_native` and `rive`. However, the `rive` package may expose additional APIs or functionality in the future.

We encourage you to start using `rive_native` today and share your feedback with us.

### Key Differences Between `rive_native` and `rive`


- **C++ Runtime Integration**:  
  `rive_native` is built on Rive's [C++ runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-runtime) via FFI, replacing the Dart implementation. This ensures a consistent experience across platforms and the Rive Editor, while unlocking performance improvements and new features exclusive to the C++ runtime, such as:  
  - [Responsive Layouts](/editor/layouts/)  
  - [Scrolling](/editor/layouts/scrolling)  
  - [N-Slicing](/editor/layouts/n-slicing)  
  - [Vector Feathering](https://rive.app/blog/introducing-vector-feathering)

- **Rive Renderer Support**:  
  `rive_native` introduces the [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/renderer) to Flutter. While you can still use the Flutter-based renderer (Dart/Impeller), the Rive Renderer is recommended for performance-critical use cases. Some features, like Vector Feathering, are only supported with the Rive Renderer. For more details, see our [Feature Support page](/feature-support).

## Getting Started

`rive_native` is not yet publicly available on GitHub but will be soon. For now, you can pull the source code and example by running:

```bash
dart pub unpack rive_native # Unpack the package source code and example app
cd rive_native/example      # Navigate to the example folder
flutter create .            # Create the platform folders
flutter pub get             # Fetch dependencies
flutter run                 # Run the example app
```

A higher-level declarative API is under development to simplify working with Rive graphics in Flutter.

For an example implementation, see the `rive_player.dart` file in `rive_native/example/rive_player.dart`.

## Troubleshooting

The required native libraries should be automatically downloaded during the build step (`flutter run` or `flutter build`). If you encounter issues, try the following:

1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`

Alternatively, you can manually run the `rive_native` setup script. In the root of your Flutter app, execute:

```bash
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --platform macos
```

This will clean the `rive_native` setup and download the platform-specific libraries specified with the `--platform` flag. Refer to the **Platform Support** section above for details.

---

## Building `rive_native`

By default, prebuilt native libraries are downloaded and used. If you prefer to build the libraries yourself, use the `--build` flag with the setup script:

```bash
flutter clean # Important
dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --build --platform macos
```

> **Note**: Building the libraries requires specific tooling on your machine. Additional documentation will be provided soon.

## Testing

Shared libraries are included in the download/build process. If you encounter issues using `rive_native` in your tests, please reach out to us for assistance.
