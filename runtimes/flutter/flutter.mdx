## Overview

This guide documents how to use the Rive Flutter runtime to easily integrate Rive graphics in your Flutter apps.

<Info>
Already using Rive Flutter? See our [Migration Guide](/runtimes/flutter/migration-guide) for information on adopting the latest version.
</Info>

## Quick start

See our [quick start example](https://zapp.run/edit/rive-car-wash-zf160614f170?entry=lib/main.dart&file=lib/main.dart) that shows how to play a Rive graphic in Flutter.

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to integrate Rive into your Flutter apps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Rive package dependency">
    Check out Rive's [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/rive) page to get the latest version.

    ```yaml
    # pubspec.yaml
    dependencies:
      rive: ^0.14.0 # or latest version
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Import the Rive package">
    Import the Rive runtime library in the file you're looking to integrate Rive animations into.

    ```dart
    import 'package:rive/rive.dart';
    ```

    Consider doing a named import to avoid conflicts with other libraries:

    ```dart
    import 'package:rive/rive.dart' as rive;
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Rive">

  <Info>
  **Important:** You must call `RiveNative.init` at the start of your app, or before you use Rive. For example, in `main.dart`:
  </Info>

  ```dart
  import 'package:rive/rive.dart';

  Future<void> main() async {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await RiveNative.init(); // Call init before using Rive
    runApp(const MyApp());
  }
  ```
  </Step>  
  <Step title="Add a Rive widget">
    There are several ways to render Rive graphics in Flutter. We recommend using the `RiveWidget`, and optionally the `RiveWidgetBuilder`.
    - The `RiveWidgetBuilder` handles file loading, error states, and resource management automatically.
    - The `RiveWidget` is responsible for rendering the graphic and exposing common view configuration.

        }

        class _ExampleRiveBuilderState extends State<ExampleRiveBuilder> {
          late final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromAsset("assets/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);

          @override
          void dispose() {
            fileLoader.dispose();
            super.dispose();
          }

              fileLoader: fileLoader,
              builder: (context, state) => switch (state) {
                RiveLoading() => const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
                RiveFailed() => ErrorWidget.withDetails(
                    message: state.error.toString(),
                    error: FlutterError(state.error.toString()),
                  ),
                RiveLoaded() => RiveWidget(
                    controller: state.controller,
                    fit: Fit.cover,
                  )
              },
            );
          }
        }
        ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab title="Using RiveWidget directly">
        ```dart
        class ExampleBasic extends StatefulWidget {
          const ExampleBasic({super.key});

          @override
          State<ExampleBasic> createState() => _ExampleBasicState();
        }

        class _ExampleBasicState extends State<ExampleBasic> {
          late File file;
          late RiveWidgetController controller;
          bool isInitialized = false;

          @override
          void initState() {
            super.initState();
            initRive();
          }

          void initRive() async {
            file = (await File.asset("assets/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive))!;
            controller = RiveWidgetController(file);
            setState(() => isInitialized = true);
          }

          @override
          void dispose() {

            if (!isInitialized) {
              return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            }
            return RiveWidget(
              controller: controller,
              fit: Fit.cover,
            );
          }
        }
        ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Loading from different sources">
    **From Asset Bundle:**

    Make sure you add the Rive files to your asset bundle and reference them in `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    # pubspec.yaml
    assets:
        - assets/vehicles.riv
    ```

    ```dart
    // Using FileLoader (with RiveWidgetBuilder)
    final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromAsset("assets/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);

    // Using File directly
    final file = await File.asset("assets/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);
    ```

    **From URL:**

    ```dart
    // Using FileLoader (with RiveWidgetBuilder)
    final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromUrl("https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);

    // Using File directly
    final file = await File.url("https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);
    ```

    **From Rive File:**

    ```dart
    // Using FileLoader (with RiveWidgetBuilder)
    final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromFile(existingFile, riveFactory: Factory.rive);
    ```
  </Step>   
</Steps>

## Key components

### `RiveWidget`

The `RiveWidget` is responsible for displaying Rive graphics.

**Properties:**

- `controller` [**required**]: The `RiveWidgetController` that manages the Rive graphic
- `fit`: How the artboard should fit within the widget (default: `contain`)
- `alignment`: How the artboard should be aligned within the widget (default: `center`)
- `hitTestBehavior`: How pointer events should be handled (default: `opaque`)
- `cursor`: The cursor to display when hovering over the widget (default: `defer`)
- `layoutScaleFactor`: Scale factor when using `Fit.layout` (default: `1.0`)

### `RiveWidgetBuilder`

The `RiveWidgetBuilder` is a higher-level widget that handles file loading, error states, and resource management automatically.

**Properties:**

- `fileLoader` [**required**]: The `FileLoader` for loading the Rive file
- `builder` [**required**]: Function that builds the widget based on state
- `artboardSelector`: Which artboard to use (default: `ArtboardDefault()`)
- `stateMachineSelector`: Which state machine to use (default: `StateMachineDefault()`)
- `dataBind`: How to bind view model data (optional)
- `controller`: Optional custom controller builder
- `onLoaded`: Callback when Rive state is loaded
- `onFailed`: Callback when Rive state fails to load

### `RiveWidgetController`

The `RiveWidgetController` manages the graphic.

**Creating a Controller:**

```dart
// Using default artboard and state machine
final controller = RiveWidgetController(file);

// Specifying artboard and state machine
final controller = RiveWidgetController(
  file,
  artboardSelector: ArtboardSelector.byName("MyArtboard"),
  stateMachineSelector: StateMachineSelector.byName("MyStateMachine"),
);
```

**Data Binding:**

```dart
// Auto-bind with default view model instance
final viewModelInstance = controller.dataBind(DataBind.auto());

// Bind by specific instance
final viewModelInstance = controller.dataBind(DataBind.byInstance(myInstance));

// Bind by name
final viewModelInstance = controller.dataBind(DataBind.byName("MyViewModel"));
```

### File loading

The `FileLoader` class provides a unified way to load Rive files from different sources.

**Loading from Assets:**

```dart
final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromAsset(
  "assets/vehicles.riv",
  riveFactory: Factory.rive,
);
```

**Loading from URL:**

```dart
final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromUrl(
  "https://example.com/animation.riv",
  riveFactory: Factory.rive,
);
```

**Loading from Existing File:**

```dart
final fileLoader = FileLoader.fromFile(
  existingFile,
  riveFactory: Factory.rive,
);
```

Or you can load files directly using the `File` class:

```dart
// Load from asset
final file = await File.asset("assets/vehicles.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);
// Load from URL
final file = await File.url("https://example.com/animation.riv", riveFactory:
Factory.rive);
// Load from path
final file = await File.path("/path/to/animation.riv", riveFactory: Factory.rive);
// Load from bytes
final file = await File.decode(bytes, riveFactory: Factory.rive);
```

## Error handling

The Rive Flutter package provides specific exception types for different error scenarios:

- `RiveFileLoaderException`: Thrown when file loading fails
- `RiveArtboardException`: Thrown when artboard selection fails
- `RiveStateMachineException`: Thrown when state machine selection fails
- `RiveDataBindException`: Thrown when data binding fails

## Resource management

### Manual resource management (`RiveWidget`)

When using `RiveWidget` directly, you are responsible for managing all resources:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Dispose resources in reverse order of creation
  viewModelInstance.dispose();
  controller.dispose();
  file.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

### Automatic resource management (`RiveWidgetBuilder`)

When using `RiveWidgetBuilder`, the widget automatically manages most resources. You only need to dispose the file loader:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  fileLoader.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```
<Note>
Because the resources are managed by the `RiveWidgetBuilder`, you will not be able to access the `RiveWidgetController` (and other state) after the widget is disposed. If you need to access the controller after the widget is disposed, consider creating the file and controller yourself.

The exception to this is the `FileLoader`, which you control. This loader can be reused across multiple `RiveWidgetBuilder` instances. The underlying `File` will only be loaded once. The `File` will be disposed when the `FileLoader` is disposed.
</Note>

## Specifying a renderer

When creating a Rive `File` or `FileLoader`, you need to specify a factory to use:
- `Factory.rive` for the Rive renderer
- `Factory.flutter` for the Flutter renderer (Skia or Impeller)

You can use different renderers for different graphics in your app.

Some considerations when choosing a renderer:
- If you plan on showing many Rive graphics that are all drawing to different Rive widgets, consider using `Factory.flutter` to reduce the native overhead of allocating native render targets and textures.
- If you are showing a complex graphic, consider using `Factory.rive` to take advantage of the Rive renderer's optimizations.
- Vector Feathering is only available with `Factory.rive`, so if you need that feature, use the Rive renderer.

For more information see [Choosing a Renderer](/runtimes/choose-a-renderer/).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Rive in Flutter, consider the following:
- Ensure you have called `RiveNative.init()` before using any Rive features.
- Check the console for any error messages related to Rive.
- Make sure your Rive files are correctly referenced in `pubspec.yaml` and exist in the specified paths.
- If using `RiveWidgetBuilder`, ensure you handle all possible states (loading, loaded, failed) in the builder function.

### Build errors

If you encounter build errors related to Rive, ensure that:
- You have the correct version of the Rive package in your `pubspec.yaml`.
- You have run `flutter pub get` to fetch the latest dependencies.

If you're still having issues, please see the [Troubleshooting section](/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#troubleshooting) in the Rive Native documentation.

## Manually building Rive native libraries

Rive automatically downloads the native libraries for you as part of the `rive_native` plugin.

However, if you need to manually build the native libraries, see the [build section](/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#building-rive-native) in the Rive Native documentation.
