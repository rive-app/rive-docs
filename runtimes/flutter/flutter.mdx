## Overview 

This guide documents how to get started using the Flutter runtime library. Rive runtime libraries are open-source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter). This library contains an API for Flutter apps to easily integrate their Rive assets.

## Quick Start

See our [quick start example](https://zapp.run/edit/rive-car-wash-zf160614f170?entry=lib/main.dart&file=lib/main.dart) that shows how to play a Rive animation in Flutter.

## Getting Started 

Follow the steps below for a quick start on integrating Rive into your Flutter apps.

### 1. Add the Rive package dependency

Check out Rive's [pub.dev](https://rive.app/community/doc/flutter/docqzmYRZmvF) page to get the latest version.

```json
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  rive: 0.13.14
```

### 2. Import the Rive package 

Import the Rive runtime library in the file you're looking to integrate Rive animations into.

```javascript
import 'package:rive/rive.dart';
```

### 3. Add a RiveAnimation widget 

There are a few different methods to integrating Rive Animations into your apps easily:

#### Via URL 

```javascript
RiveAnimation.network(
  'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
)
```

#### Via Asset Bundle 

Make sure you add the Rive file to your asset bundle and reference it in `pubspec.yaml`

```javascript
RiveAnimation.asset(
  'assets/vehicles.riv',
)
```

In `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...

# To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
assets:
    - assets/vehicles.riv
```

Via Relative Path

```javascript
RiveAnimation.file('path/to/local/file.riv')
```

#### Via Direct 

If you use the same Rive file multiple times in your application, you may want to create a single `RiveFile` instance for that `.riv`, and feed it directly to `RiveAnimation` so that the Rive file is only loaded once.

```javascript
final riveFile = await RiveFile.asset('assets/truck.riv');

RiveAnimation.direct(riveFile)
```

## Complete example 

```javascript
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rive/rive.dart';

void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
      home: MyRiveAnimation(),
    ));

class MyRiveAnimation extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: RiveAnimation.network(
          'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
