## Responsive Layout

Rive’s new Layout feature lets you design resizable artboards with built-in responsive behavior, configured directly in the graphic. Just set a **Fit** of type **Layout** at runtime and the artboard will resize automatically. Optionally, provide a **Layout Scale Factor** to further adjust the scale of the content.

For more Editor information and how to configure your graphic see [Layouts Overview](../editor/layouts/layouts-overview).

<Note>
 The **Alignment** property will not have an effect when the using a **Fit** of type **Layout**.
</Note>

<Warning>
 Check the [Feature Support](/feature-support) page to see if this feature is already supported for your runtime.

    **Steps**

    1. Set `Fit` to `Fit.Layout` - this will automatically scale and resize the artboard to match the canvas size when calling `resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas()`.
    2. Optionally set `layoutScaleFactor` for manual control of the artboard size (scale factor).
    3. Subscribe to `window.onresize` and call `resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas()` to adjust the artboard size as the canvas and window changes.
    4. Subscribe to **device pixel ratio** changes and call `resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas()` to ensure the artboard updates correctly on various screen densities. For example, when dragging the window between multiple monitors with different device pixel ratios.

    ```javascript
    <style>
      body {
        background: #f0f0f0;
        margin: 0;
        overflow: hidden;
      }

      canvas {
        background-color: red;
        display: block;
        width: 100vw;
        height: 100vh;
      }
    </style>

    <canvas id="riveCanvas"></canvas>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@rive-app/canvas@latest"></script>

    <script>
      const rive = new Rive({
        src: "your-rive-file.riv",
        autoplay: true,
        canvas: riveCanvas,
        layout: new Layout({
          fit: Fit.Layout,
          // layoutScaleFactor: 2, // 2x scale of the layout, when using `Fit.Layout`. This allows you to resize the layout as needed.
        }),
        stateMachines: ["State Machine 1"],
        onLoad: () => {
          computeSize();
        },
      });

      function computeSize() {
        rive.resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas();
      }

      // Subscribe to window size changes and update call `resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas`
      window.onresize = computeSize;

      // Subscribe to devicePixelRatio changes and call `resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas`
      window
        .matchMedia(`(resolution: ${window.devicePixelRatio}dppx)`)
        .addEventListener("change", computeSize);

    **Steps**

    1. Set `fit` to `Fit.Layout` in the `Layout` object - this will automatically scale and resize the artboard to match the canvas size.
    2. Pass the `Layout` object to the `layout` prop in `useRive`.
    3. Optionally set `layoutScaleFactor` in the `Layout` object for manual control of the artboard's scale factor.
    4. The React runtime automatically handles window resizing and device pixel ratio changes.

  <Tab title="Apple">
    **Examples**

    - [SwiftUI](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios/blob/main/Example-iOS/Source/Examples/SwiftUI/SwiftLayout.swift)

    **Steps**

    1. Set `fit` on an instance of `RiveViewModel` to `layout`
    2. Optionally set `layoutScaleFactor` on `RiveViewModel` for manual control of an artboard's scale factor.

    <Info>
     To enable automatically determining the scale factor, set `.layoutScaleFactor` to `RiveViewModel.layoutScaleFactorAutomatic`. This is the default value; it is equivalent to `-1`. When set, Rive will listen for window and screen changes for the view model's view, and automatically apply the correct scale factor for the current view hierarchy.
    </Info>
    ```swift
    let viewModel = RiveViewModel(fileName: "...")
    viewModel.fit = .layout
    viewModel.layoutScaleFactor = RiveViewModel.layoutScaleFactorAutomatic // Allow Rive to determine the scale factor
    viewModel.layoutScaleFactor = 2.0 // Or, explicitly set the scale factor
    ```

  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Android">
    **Examples**

    See the [Layout](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/rive/runtime/example/LayoutActivity.kt) example.

    **Steps**

    1. Set the XML `riveLayout` type to `"LAYOUT"`:

    ```kotlin
    <app.rive.runtime.kotlin.RiveAnimationView
        ...
        app:riveFit="LAYOUT"
    />
    ```

    2. Alternatively, use a reference to the `RiveAnimationView` and set the `fit` property to `LAYOUT`:

    ```kotlin
    val animationView = findViewById<RiveAnimationView>(R.id.my_view)
    animationView.fit = Fit.LAYOUT
    ```

    3. To adjust the scale factor of the contents, use the `layoutScaleFactor` property. This is nullable, so by default, it will use the density as reported by `resources.displayMetrics.density`. You can override this to any positive float value, or return control to the system by resetting to `null`:

    ```kotlin
    // Force a set scale factor
    animationView.layoutScaleFactor = 2.5f
    // Reset to system control
    animationView.layoutScaleFactor = null
    ```

    4. Additionally, the artboard size can be controlled by using the `width` and `height` properties. `resetArtboardSize()` can be used to return these values to their defaults:

    ```kotlin
    // Force a certain artboard size
    animationView.controller.activeArtboard?.width = 1000f
    animationView.controller.activeArtboard?.height = 1000f
    // Reset the artboard size to defaults
    animationView.controller.activeArtboard?.resetArtboardSize()
    ```

## Additional Layout Options

If the graphic doesn’t use Rive’s Layout feature, you can configure the layout with other **Fit** options and **Alignment** settings. See the sections below for more information on **Fit** and **Alignment**.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web">
    Use the `Layout` object to configure `Fit` and `Alignment`. See **Fit** and **Alignment** below for all enum options.

    ```javascript
    <div>
        <canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
    </div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@rive-app/canvas@latest"></script>
    <script>
        // Fill the canvas, cropping Rive if necessary
        let layout = new rive.Layout({
            fit: rive.Fit.Cover,
        });

        // Fit to the width and align to the top of the canvas
        layout = new rive.Layout({
            fit: rive.Fit.FitWidth,
            alignment: rive.Alignment.TopCenter,
        });

        // Constrain the Rive content to (minX, minY), (maxX, maxY) in the canvas
        layout = new rive.Layout({
            fit: rive.Fit.Contain,
            minX: 50,
            minY: 50,
            maxX: 100,
            maxY: 100,
        });

        const r = new rive.Rive({
            src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
            canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
            layout: layout,
            autoplay: true
        });

        // Update the layout
        r.layout = new rive.Layout({ fit: rive.Fit.Fill });
    </script>
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React">
    Use the `Layout` object to configure `Fit` and `Alignment`. See **Fit** and **Alignment** below for all enum options.

    ```javascript
    import Rive, { Layout, Fit, Alignment } from '@rive-app/react-canvas';

    export const Simple = () => (
      <Rive
        src="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv"
        layout={new Layout({ fit: Fit.Contain, alignment: Alignment.TopCenter })}
      />
    );
    ```

    With the `useRive` hook:

    ```javascript
    import { useRive, Layout, Fit, Alignment } from '@rive-app/react-canvas';

    export default function Example() {
      const { RiveComponent } = useRive({
        src: 'my-file.riv',
        artboard: 'my-artboard',
        animations: 'my-animation',
        layout: new Layout({
          fit: Fit.Cover,
          alignment: Alignment.TopCenter,
        }),
        autoplay: true,
      });

      return <RiveComponent />;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React Native">
    Set layout attributes for `Fit` and `Alignment` on the `Rive` component directly. See **Fit** and **Alignment** below for all enum options.

    ```javascript
    import Rive, { Alignment, Fit } from 'rive-react-native';

    export default function Simple() {
      return (
        <ScrollView>
          <Rive
            fit={Fit.Cover}
            alignment={Alignment.TopCenter}
            resourceName="truck_v7"
          />
        </ScrollView>
      );
    };
    ```
  </Tab>

    <Tab title="Flutter">
    <Warning>
     The current Rive Flutter runtime does not support `Fit.Layout`. The next major release will support this which will be a breaking change.
    </Warning>
    The fit and alignment options behave like their counterparts in Flutter (see `BoxFit` and `Size` as examples).

    Bounds options are absent; Flutter's layout engine and options are the preferred way to handle positioning Rive content.

    ```dart
    // Fill the canvas, cropping Rive if necessary
    var widget = const RiveAnimation.network(
      'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
      fit: BoxFit.cover,
    );

    // Fit to the width and align to the top of the canvas
    widget = const RiveAnimation.network(
      'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
      fit: BoxFit.fitWidth,
      alignment: Alignment.topCenter,
    );
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apple">
    See values and descriptions in the sections below for `Fit` and `Alignment`. The runtime provides the following enums to set on layout parameters:

    - **Fit**
      - `.fill`
      - `.contain`
      - `.cover`
      - `.fitWidth`
      - `.fitHeight`
      - `.scaleDown`
      - `.noFit`

    - **Alignment**
      - `.topLeft`
      - `.topCenter`
      - `.topRight`
      - `.centerLeft`
      - `.center`
      - `.centerRight`
      - `.bottomLeft`
      - `.bottomCenter`
      - `.bottomRight`

    ### SwiftUI

    The following example shows how to set layout parameters and switch them at runtime:

    ```swift
    struct SwiftLayout: View {
        @State private var fit: RiveFit = .contain
        @State private var alignment: RiveAlignment = .center

        var body: some View {
            VStack {
                RiveViewModel(fileName: "fancy_rive_file", fit: fit, alignment: alignment).view()
            }
            HStack {
                Text("Some Fit Examples")
            }
            HStack {
                Button("Fill") { fit = .fill }
                Button("Contain") { fit = .contain }
                Button("Cover") { fit = .cover }
            }
            HStack {
                Text("Some Alignment Examples")
            }
            HStack {
                Button("Top Left") { alignment = .topLeft }
                Button("Top Center") { alignment = .topCenter }
                Button("Top Right") { alignment = .topRight }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### UIKit

    The following example shows how to set layout parameters and switch them at runtime:

    ```swift
    class LayoutViewController: UIViewController {
        @IBOutlet weak var riveView: RiveView!
        var viewModel = RiveViewModel(fileName: "fancy_rive_file")

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            viewModel.setView(riveView)
        }

        @IBAction func fitButtonTriggered(_ sender: UIButton) {
            setFit(name: sender.currentTitle!)
        }

        @IBAction func alignmentButtonTriggered(_ sender: UIButton) {
            setAlignment(name: sender.currentTitle!)
        }

        func setFit(name: String) {
            var fit: RiveFit = .contain
            switch name {
            case "Fill": fit = .fill
            case "Contain": fit = .contain
            case "Cover": fit = .cover
            case "Fit Width": fit = .fitWidth
            case "Fit Height": fit = .fitHeight
            case "Scale Down": fit = .scaleDown
            case "None": fit = .noFit
            default: fit = .contain
            }
            viewModel.fit = fit
        }

        func setAlignment(name: String) {
            var alignment: RiveAlignment = .center
            switch name {
            case "Top Left": alignment = .topLeft
            case "Top Center": alignment = .topCenter
            case "Top Right": alignment = .topRight
            case "Center Left": alignment = .centerLeft
            case "Center": alignment = .center
            case "Center Right": alignment = .centerRight
            case "Bottom Left": alignment = .bottomLeft
            case "Bottom Center": alignment = .bottomCenter
            case "Bottom Right": alignment = .bottomRight
            default: alignment = .center
            }
            viewModel.alignment = alignment
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Android">
    The animation view can be further customized as part of specifying layout attributes.

    `riveFit` can be specified to determine how the animation should be resized to fit its container. The available choices are `NONE`, `FILL`, `CONTAIN`, `COVER`, `FIT_WIDTH`, `FIT_HEIGHT`, `SCALE_DOWN`, and `LAYOUT`.

    `riveAlignment` informs how it should be aligned within the container. The available choices are `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_CENTER`, `TOP_RIGHT`, `CENTER_LEFT`, `CENTER`, `CENTER_RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_CENTER`, and `BOTTOM_RIGHT`.

    See more about these values and meanings in the sections below.

    Specify the layout values in your Resource layout:

    ```kotlin
    <app.rive.runtime.kotlin.RiveAnimationView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:riveResource="@raw/off_road_car_blog"
        app:riveAlignment="TOP_CENTER"
        app:riveFit="FILL"
    />
    ```

    Or in your Activity code:

    ```kotlin
    animationView.fit = Fit.FILL
    animationView.alignment = Alignment.CENTER
    ```
  </Tab>


</Tabs>


## Fit

Fit determines how the Rive content will be fitted to the view. There are a number of options available:

- `Layout`: Rive content will be resized automatically based on layout constraints of the artboard to match the underlying view size. See [the above](./layout#responsive-layout) for more information on how to use this option.
- `Cover`: Rive will cover the view, preserving the aspect ratio. If the Rive content has a different ratio to the view, then the Rive content will be clipped.
- `Contain`: **(Default)** Rive content will be contained within the view, preserving the aspect ratio. If the ratios differ, then a portion of the view will be unused.
- `Fill`: Rive content will fill the available view. If the aspect ratios differ, then the Rive content will be stretched.
- `FitWidth`: Rive content will fill to the width of the view. This may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- `FitHeight`: Rive content will fill to the height of the view. This may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- `None`: Rive content will render to the size of its artboard, which may result in clipping or unfilled view space.
- `ScaleDown`: Rive content is scaled down to the size of the view, preserving the aspect ratio. This is equivalent to `Contain` when the content is larger than the canvas. If the canvas is larger, then `ScaleDown` will not scale up.

## Alignment

Alignment determines how the content aligns with respect to the view bounds. The following options are available:

- `Center` **(Default)**
- `TopLeft`
- `TopCenter`
- `TopRight`
- `CenterLeft`
- `CenterRight`
- `BottomLeft`
- `BottomCenter`
- `BottomRight`

## Bounds

The bounds for the area in which the Rive content will render can be set by providing the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. These coordinates are relative to the view in which the Rive content is contained, and all must be provided. These will override alignment settings.

- `minX`
- `minY`
- `maxX`
- `maxY`
