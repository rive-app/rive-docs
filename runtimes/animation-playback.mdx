title: 'Animation Playback'
description: 'Playing and pausing animations (legacy)'
---

<Info>
  We strongly recommend controlling your animation(s) at runtime with a [State Machine](/runtimes/state-machines), rather than controlling them individually.
</Info>

Rive lets you specify what animations and state machines to mix and play and control the play/pause state of each animation.

The term *animations* may collectively refer to both animations and state machines. In this section, we explore how to deal with specific animation playback, rather than state machines.

<Note>
 If you are trying to coordinate multiple animations' playback at runtime, consider using a state machine instead to do this for you!
</Note>


## Choosing starting animations

Starting animations can also be chosen when Rive is instantiated. The first animation on the artboard may play if one is not provided, or a state machine is not set.

  <Tab title="Web">
    ```javascript
    // Play the idle animation
    new rive.Rive({
        src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
        canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
        animations: 'idle',
        autoplay: true
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React">
    ```javascript
    // Play the idle animation
    export const Simple = () => (
      <Rive src="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv" animations="idle" />
    );

    // With `useRive` Hook:
    export default function Simple() {
      const { RiveComponent } = useRive({
        src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv',
        animations: ['idle'],
        autoplay: true,
      });

      return <RiveComponent />;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React Native">
    Currently, with the React Native runtime, you can set one animation to autoplay at the start. Despite this, see below in the playback sections to see how you can mix multiple animations on playback functions.

    ```javascript
    export default function App() {
      return (
        <View>
          <Rive
            resourceName="truck_v7"
            artboardName="Jeep"
            autoplay
            animationName="idle"
          />
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Flutter">
    ```dart
    // Create a File, Artboard, and SingleAnimationPainter
    final file = (await File.asset(
      'assets/rewards.riv',
      riveFactory: Factory.rive,
    ))!;
    final artboard = file.artboard('Main')!;
    final animationPainter = SingleAnimationPainter("Artboard Name");

    // Later create the widget
    return RiveArtboardWidget(
      artboard: artboard,
      painter: animationPainter,
    );
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apple">
    By default, `RiveViewModel` will automatically play the animation or state machine you've given it.

    ### SwiftUI
    ```javascript
    struct AnimationView: View {
        var body: some View {
            RiveViewModel(
                fileName: "dancing_banana",
                animationName: "Charleston",
                artboardName: "Banana"
            ).view()
        }
    }
    ```

    ### UIKit
    ```swift
    class AnimationViewController: UIViewController {
        @IBOutlet weak var riveView: RiveView!

        var bananaVM = RiveViewModel(
            fileName: "dancing_banana",
            animationName: "Charleston",
            artboardName: "Banana"
        )

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            bananaVM.setView(riveView)
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Android">
    With the Android runtime, specify **one** animation with the `riveAnimation` property.

    ```xml
    <app.rive.runtime.kotlin.RiveAnimationView
        app:riveAutoPlay="true"
        app:riveArtboard="Square"
        app:riveAnimation="rollaround"
        app:riveResource="@raw/artboard_animations" />
    ```

    Or

    ```kotlin
    animationView.setRiveResource(
        R.raw.artboard_animations,
        artboardName = "Square",
        animationName = "rollaround",
        autoplay = true
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
## Controlling playback

Playback of each animation and state machine can be separately controlled. You can play and pause playback using the `play` , `pause` and `stop` methods, either passing in the names of the animations you want to affect or passing in nothing which will affect all instanced animations.

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Web">

      #### Invoking Playback Controls

      With the web runtime, you can provide callback functions to receive notification when certain animation events have occurred:

      - `onLoad` when a rive file has been loaded and initialized; it's now ready for playback
      - `onPlay` when one or more animations play; provides a list of animations
      - `onPause` when one or more animations pause; provides a list of animations
      - `onStop` when one or more animations are stopped; provides a list of animations
      - `onLoop` when an animation loops; provides the animation name

      See the following Codesandbox link to try out the below code: [https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/adoring-sea-n7m59f](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/adoring-sea-n7m59f)

      ```javascript
      const idleButton = document.getElementById("idle");
      const wipersButton = document.getElementById("wipers");
      const loopDiv = document.getElementById("loop");

      const truck = new rive.Rive({
        src: "https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv",
        artboard: "Jeep",
        canvas: document.getElementById("canvas"),
        layout: new rive.Layout({ fit: "fill" }),
        // Listen for play events to update button text
        onPlay: (event) => {
          const names = event.data;
          names.forEach((name) => {
            if (name === "idle") {
              idleButton.innerHTML = "Stop Truck";
            } else if (name === "windshield_wipers") {
              wipersButton.innerHTML = "Stop Wipers";
            }
          });
        },
        // Listen for pause events to update button text
        onPause: (event) => {
          const names = event.data;
          names.forEach((name) => {
            if (name === "idle") {
              idleButton.innerHTML = "Start Truck";
            } else if (name === "windshield_wipers") {
              wipersButton.innerHTML = "Start Wipers";
            }
          });
        },
        onLoop: (event) => {
          loopDiv.innerHTML = `Looped Animation: ${event.data.animation}`;
        }
      });

      idleButton.onclick = (_) =>
        truck.playingAnimationNames.includes("idle")
          ? truck.pause("idle")
          : truck.play("idle");

      wipersButton.onclick = (_) =>
        truck.playingAnimationNames.includes("windshield_wipers")
          ? truck.pause("windshield_wipers")
          : truck.play("windshield_wipers");
      ```
  </Tab>

    <Tab title="React">
#### Invoking Playback Controls

Very similarly to Web, you can pass in Rive params and callbacks for certain animation events. See the Web tab for some examples of callbacks you can set. Additionally, you can use the `rive` object returned from the `useRive` hook to invoke playback controls.

See the example below here: [https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/adoring-sea-n7m59f](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/adoring-sea-n7m59f)

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRive, Layout, Fit } from "@rive-app/react-canvas";

export default function App() {
  const [truckButtonText, setTruckButtonText] = useState("Start Truck");
  const [wiperButtonText, setWiperButtonText] = useState("Start Wipers");

  // animation will show the first frame but not start playing
  const { rive, RiveComponent } = useRive({
    src: "https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv",
    artboard: "Jeep",
    layout: new Layout({ fit: Fit.Cover }),
    // Listen for play events to update button text
    onPlay: (event) => {
      const names = event.data;
      names.forEach((name) => {
        if (name === "idle") {
          setTruckButtonText("Stop Truck");
        } else if (name === "windshield_wipers") {
          setWiperButtonText("Stop Wipers");
        }
      });
    },
    // Listen for pause events to update button text
    onPause: (event) => {
      const names = event.data;
      names.forEach((name) => {
        if (name === "idle") {
          setTruckButtonText("Start Truck");
        } else if (name === "windshield_wipers") {
          setWiperButtonText("Start Wipers");
        }
      });
    }
  });

  function onStartTruckClick() {
    if (rive) {
      if (rive.playingAnimationNames.includes("idle")) {
        rive.pause("idle");
      } else {
        rive.play("idle");
      }
    }
  }

  function onStartWiperClick() {
    if (rive) {
      if (rive.playingAnimationNames.includes("windshield_wipers")) {
        rive.pause("windshield_wipers");
      } else {
        rive.play("windshield_wipers");
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <RiveComponent style={{ height: "1000px" }} />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button id="idle" onClick={onStartTruckClick}>
          {truckButtonText}
        </button>
        <button id="wipers" onClick={onStartWiperClick}>
          {wiperButtonText}
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="React Native">
      #### Invoking Playback Controls

      To trigger animation playback controls, set a `ref` on the Rive component rendered. Once the `ref` is populated, you can trigger functions such as `play`, `pause`, etc. See the `ref` method docs for React Native [Rive Ref Methods](/runtimes/react-native/rive-ref-methods).

      ```javascript
      import Rive, { RiveRef } from 'rive-react-native'

      export default function App() {
        const riveRef = React.useRef<RiveRef>(null);

        const handlePlayPress = () => {
          riveRef?.current?.play();
        };

        const handlePausePress = () => {
          riveRef?.current?.pause();
        };

        return (
          <View>
            <Rive
              resourceName="truck_v7"
              animationName="idle"
              ref={riveRef}
            />
            <Button onPress={handlePlayPress} title="play">
            <Button onPress={handlePausePress} title="pause">
          </View>
        );
      }
      ```
  </Tab>


  <Tab title="Flutter">
    Flutter handles things a little differently compared to the other runtimes due to its reactive nature.

    Every animation and state machine in Flutter has an underlying painter that manages the state/painting/advancing.

    In order to access controls for animations, you'll need to create a `SingleAnimationPainter` or `StateMachinePainter` and pass it to the `RiveArtboardWidget`.

    Or you can create `RiveWidgetController` and pass it to the `RiveWidget` to control playback of state machines with a more feature-rich API (recommended).

    This painter concept is extensible, and you can also create your own custom painter, for example, to control multiple animations at once.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Apple">
    #### Invoking Playback Controls

    After creating a `RiveViewModel`, you can invoke animation playback control methods on a reference to this view model.

    Very often that will be all that is needed to display your Rive asset. However, we have some convenient controls for when you want more fine-grained control of when it plays and doesn't.

    You can also choose the loop mode of the animation as additional parameters as needed. Along with playing animations, you similarly have the ability to pause, stop, and reset animation(s).

    Playing without

    - `play(animationName: String? = nil, loop: Loop = .autoLoop, direction: Direction = .autoDirection)`
      - `animationName` - Name of the animation to play
      - `loop` - Loop mode to play the animation in. Possible values listed below:
        - `oneShot` - plays animation through once
        - `loop` - plays through animation and repeats from the set starting time
        - `pingPong` - plays animation from start -&gt; end, then end -&gt; start on repeat
        - `autoLoop` (default) - plays through the loop setting set on the animation
      - `direction` - Direction to play the animation in
        - `backwards` - plays through animation timeline backward
        - `forwards` - plays through animation timeline forwards
        - `autoDirection` - plays through direction set on the animation
    - `pause()`
    - `stop()`
    - `reset()`

### Play

If you set autoplay to false you can play the active animation or state machine very simply.

```swift
simpleVM.play()
```

If there are multiple animations on the active artboard you can play a specific one.

```swift
simpleVM.play(animationName: "Fancy Animation")
```

### Pause/Stop/Reset

Based on certain events in your app you may want to adjust the playback further.

    ```swift
    simpleVM.pause()
    simpleVM.stop()
    simpleVM.reset()
    ```

    #### Player Delegates

    This runtime allows for delegates that can be set on the `RiveViewModel`. You can use delegates to define functions that hook into when certain playback events are invoked. See the below class for how you can hook into the following playback events:
      - played
      - paused
      - stopped
      - advanced
      - animation looped


```swift
class ToggleViewModel: RiveViewModel {
  private let onAnimation: String = "On"
  private let offAnimation: String = "Off"
  private let startAnimation: String = "StartOff"

  var action: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil
  var isOn = false {
      didSet {
          stop()
          play(animationName: isOn ? onAnimation : offAnimation)
          action?(isOn)
      }
  }

  init() {
      super.init(fileName: "toggle", animationName: startAnimation, fit: .cover)
  }

  func view(_ action: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil) -> some View {
      self.action = action
      return super.view().frame(width: 100, height: 50, alignment: .center)
  }

  // When an animation is played
  override func player(playedWithModel riveModel: RiveModel?) {
    if let animationName = riveModel?.animation?.name() {...}
  }
  // When an animation is paused
  override func player(pausedWithModel riveModel: RiveModel?) {
    if let animationName = riveModel?.animation?.name() {...}
  }
  // When an animation is stopped
  override func player(stoppedWithModel riveModel: RiveModel?) {
    if let animationName = riveModel?.animation?.name() {...}
  }
  // When an animation is looped
  override func player(loopedWithModel riveModel: RiveModel?, type: Int) {
    if let animationName = riveModel?.animation?.name() {...}
  }
  // When an animation is advanced
  override func player(didAdvanceby seconds: Double, riveModel: RiveModel?) {...}
}
```
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Android">
    #### Invoking Playback Controls

    After setting the Rive Resource with your animation view, you can invoke animation playback control methods.

    Along with programmatically playing an animation, you can also choose the loop mode and direction of the animation as additional parameters as needed. You can additionally pause or stop an animation as well.

    ```kotlin
    // Play one animation
    animationView.play("rollaround")

    // Set loop mode and direction
    animationView.play("rollaround", Loop.ONE_SHOT, Direction.Backwards)

    animationView.pause()
    animationView.pause("bouncing")

    animationView.stop()
    animationView.stop("bouncing")
    ```

    #### Animation Event Listeners

    The Rive Android runtime also allows listener registration. Check out the events section in the
    [rive player](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/rive/runtime/example/AndroidPlayerActivity.kt) for an example of how this works.

    ```kotlin
    val listener = object : Listener {
        override fun notifyPlay(animation: PlayableInstance) {
            var text: String? = null
            if (animation is LinearAnimationInstance) {
                text = animation.name
            }
        }

        override fun notifyPause(animation: PlayableInstance) {
            var text: String? = null
            if (animation is LinearAnimationInstance) {
                text = animation.name
            }
        }

        override fun notifyStop(animation: PlayableInstance) {
            var text: String? = null
            if (animation is LinearAnimationInstance) {
                text = animation.name
            }
        }

        override fun notifyLoop(animation: PlayableInstance) {
            var text: String? = null
            if (animation is LinearAnimationInstance) {
                text = animation.name
            }
        }
    }
    animationView.registerListener(listener)
    ```
