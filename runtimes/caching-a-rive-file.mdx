title: 'Caching a Rive File'
description: ''
---

Under most circumstances a `.riv` file should load quickly and managing the `RiveFile` yourself is not necessary. But if you intend to use the same `.riv` file in multiple parts of your application, or even on the same screen, it might be advantageous to load the file once and keep it in memory.

## Example Usage

<Tabs>


    <Tab title="Flutter">
        
        The following is a basic example to illustrate how to preload a Rive file, and pass the data directly to the `RiveAnimation.direct()` constructor: 

        ```javascript
        class PreloadRive extends StatefulWidget {
        const PreloadRive({super.key});

        @override
        State<PreloadRive> createState() => _PreloadRiveState();
        }

        class _PreloadRiveState extends State<PreloadRive> {
        RiveFile? _file; // You can maintain this reference to have a cached version

        @override
        void initState() {
            super.initState();
            preload();
        }

        Future<void> preload() async {
            rootBundle.load('assets/little_machine.riv').then(
            (data) async {
                // Load the RiveFile from the binary data.
                setState(() {
                _file = RiveFile.import(data);
                });
            },
            );
        }

        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            return (_file == null)
                ? const SizedBox.shrink()
                : RiveAnimation.direct(_file!);
        }
        }
        ```

        ### Other Considerations

        #### Managing State 

        How the `RiveFile` is kept alive in state and shared to other widgets is up to you and your preferred state management solution. One approach can be to wait for the Rive file to load in `main`, or during the startup screen, and using the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package to expose the data to the whole application.

        Or if the animation is only needed in a nested section of your application, then it might be preferable to delay loading the animation until necessary.

        #### Memory

        By managing the RiveFile yourself you can have finer control over the memory used in your application. This will be especially beneficial if the same Rive file is being used in multiple parts of your application, or used simultaneously in multiple `RiveAnimation` widgets.

        You can make use of Flutter DevTools’ [memory tooling](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/memory#memory-view-guide) for additional investigation if needed or desired.

        #### Network Assets 

        The easiest way to load a Rive animation over the Internet is by using `RiveAnimation.network(url)`. However, similar considerations apply to a network asset regarding memory and sharing a Rive file across multiple widgets/pages.

        The following can be used to load a Rive file over the network :

        ```javascript
        final riveFile = await RiveFile.network('YOUR:URL');
        ```

        The reference can then be kept alive in memory and the `riveFile` can be passed to `RiveAnimation.direct`.

        Here’s a simplified example showing how to integrate the `useRiveFile` hook to reuse a `RiveFile` across components

        ```javascript
        import React, { useState } from 'react';
        import { useRiveFile } from '@rive-app/react-canvas';

        // Custom Wrapper component to display the Rive animation
        const RiveAnimation = ({ riveFile }) => {
            const { RiveComponent } = useRive({
                riveFile: riveFile,
                autoplay: true
            });

            return <RiveComponent/>;
        };

        function App() {
        const { riveFile, status } = useRiveFile({
            src: 'https://cdn.rive.app/animations/myrivefile.riv',
        });

        const [instanceCount] = useState(5); // Number of RiveAnimation components to render

        if (status === 'idle') {
            return <div>Idle...</div>;
        }

        if (status === 'loading') {
            return <div>Loading...</div>;
        }

        if (status === 'failed') {
            return <div>Failed to load Rive file.</div>;
        }

        // Each RiveAnimation component uses the RiveFile we loaded earlier, so it is only fetched and initialized once
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <header className="App-header">Rive Instances</header>
                <div className="rive-list">
                {Array.from({ length: instanceCount }, (_, index) => (
                    <RiveAnimation key={`rive-instance-${index}`} riveFile={riveFile} />
                ))}
                </div>
            </div>
            );
        
        }

        export default App;

        The following is a basic example to illustrate how to preload a Rive file, and pass the data to multiple Rive instances:

        ```javascript
        const rive = require("@rive-app/canvas");

        let riveInstances = [];

        function loadRiveFile(src, onSuccess, onError) {
        const file = new rive.RiveFile({
            src: src,
            onLoad: () => onSuccess(file),
            onLoadError: onError,
        });
        // Remember to call init() to trigger the load;
        file.init().catch(onError);
        }

        function setupRiveInstance(loadedRiveFile, canvasId) {
        const canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
        if (!canvas) return;

        const riveInstance = new rive.Rive({
            riveFile: loadedRiveFile,
            // Be sure to specify the correct state machine (or animation) name
            stateMachines: "Motion", // Name of the State Machine to play
            canvas: canvas,
            layout: new rive.Layout({
            fit: rive.Fit.FitWidth,
            alignment: rive.Alignment.Center,
            }),
            autoplay: true,
            onLoad: () => {
            // Prevent a blurry canvas by using the device pixel ratio
            riveInstance.resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas();
            },
        });

        riveInstances.push(riveInstance);
        }

        // Loads the .riv file and initializes multiple Rive instances using the same loaded RiveFile in memory
        loadRiveFile(
        "clean_the_car.riv",
        (file) => {
            setupRiveInstance(file, "rive-canvas-1");
            setupRiveInstance(file, "rive-canvas-2");
            // You could also store a reference to the loaded RiveFile here so you're able to initialize other Rive instances later.
        },
        (error) => {
            console.error("Failed to load Rive file:", error);
        }
        );

        // Resize the drawing surface for all instances if the window resizes
        window.addEventListener(
        "resize",
        () => {
            riveInstances.forEach((instance) => {
            if (instance) {
                instance.resizeDrawingSurfaceToCanvas();
            }
            });
        },
        false
        );
        ```

    <Tab title="Apple">
        ```swift
        // Cache a RiveFile somewhere to cache for reuse
        let file = try! RiveFile(resource: "file", loadCdn: false)

        // For example purposes, a type that reuses a single RiveFile
        // when creating new view models for given state machines or artboards.
        class ViewModelGenerator {
            /// The RiveFile to reuse when generating new view models.
            private let file: RiveFile

            init(file: RiveFile) {
                self.file = file
            }
            
            // Returns a new view model using a cached RiveFile.
            // This means that the RiveFile will not have to be reparsed
            // each time a view model is generated.
            func viewModel(stateMachine: String?, artboard: String?) -> RiveViewModel {
                // While one RiveFile can be cached and reused, each view model
                // should have its own model as to not share state.
                let model = RiveModel(riveFile: file)
                return RiveViewModel(model, stateMachineName: stateMachine, artboardName: artboard)
            }
        }
        ```

        When using the `RiveViewModel(fileName:)` initializer, the Apple runtime does not cache file usage; that has to be handled manually. You may find that when reusing the same file, your memory usage increases (over time) as you create more view models. This is when you should consider caching the underlying file for reuse.

        Reusing a single `RiveFile` (when applicable) will reduce the overall memory usage of your application. If your `.riv` can be reused across multiple views, where each view requires the same file but uses different artboards or state machines, consider caching the `RiveFile` before creating your view models. While one `RiveFile` can be cached, to ensure that each view is in its own state, you must create a unique `RiveModel` per `RiveViewModel` instance.
