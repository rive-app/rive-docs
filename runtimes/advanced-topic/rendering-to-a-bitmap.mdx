Rendering to a bitmap at runtime is useful for scenarios such as snapshot testing and rendering video encoded from data-bound files.

Currently only the Android runtime provides built-in support for runtime rendering to a bitmap.

<Note>
  For rendering to a bitmap from the Rive Editor, see [Exporting for Video or Static Design](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-video-and-static-design).

    Rendering to a bitmap is not supported directly in the React runtime. For offline or server-side rendering, you can use external tools like [Revideo](https://github.com/redotvideo/examples/tree/main/rive-explanation-video) and [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/rive/), both of which support Rive.

          See the `RiveSnapshotActivity` example for a demonstration of this feature.

        Rendering to a bitmap is done using the `RenderBuffer` class or the `onBitmapAvailable` callback in the `Rive` Composable.

      <Tab title="Legacy">
        Rendering to a bitmap was technically possible in the legacy runtime by rendering to a Canvas backed by a bitmap or by sub-classing the renderer, but it was not a built-in feature and required more effort to implement. There are no plans to retrofit this feature into the legacy runtime.
