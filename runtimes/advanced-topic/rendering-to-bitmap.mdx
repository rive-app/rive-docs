Rendering to bitmap at runtime is useful for scenarios such as snapshot testing and rendering video encoded from data-bound files.

Currently only the Android runtime provides built-in support for rendering.

<Note>
  For rendering to bit map from the Rive Editor, see [Exporting for Video or Static Design](/editor/exporting/exporting-for-video-and-static-design).

    Rendering to bitmap is not supported directly in the React runtime. For offline or server-side rendering, you can use external tools like
    [ReVideo](https://x.com/matternjustus/status/1816439475783815643?s=46&t=jqRQ1ggfUR6vYiNQ8wOU3A) and
    [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), both of which support Rive.

      See the `RiveSnapshotActivity` example for a demonstration of this feature.

    Rendering to bitmap is done using the `RenderBuffer` class or the `onBitmapAvailable` callback in the `Rive` Composable.

    <Callout icon="ban">
      Rendering to a Bitmap was technically possible in the legacy runtime by rendering to a Canvas backed by a Bitmap or by sub-classing the renderer, but it was not a built-in feature and required more effort to implement. There are no plans to retrofit this feature into the legacy runtime.
