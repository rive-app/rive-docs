      ## Components
      Rive Android's binary size is comprised of a number of components:
      - Kotlin code compiled to a DEX file
      - Rive Android native shared library (`librive-android.so`), which has the following third party static dependencies:
          | Dependency | Reason                     |
          | ---------- | -------------------------- |
          | HarfBuzz   | Text rendering             |
          | Miniaudio  | Audio support              |
          | SheenBidi  | Bidirectional text support |
          | Yoga       | Layout                     |
          - Additionally, it is comprised of the Rive Android C++ bindings, the Rive C++ runtime, and the Rive Renderer.
      - C++ standard library (shared .so file - 394KB download size, 1.2MB install size for ARM-v8a)
      - The following Android dependencies:
          | Dependency                                 | Reason                         |
          | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
          | Compose: runtime, ui, ui-android           | Compose support                |
          | Lifecycle: runtime-ktx and runtime-compose | Lifecycle awareness in Compose |
          | Startup: startup-runtime                   | Automatic initialization       |
          | ReLinker                                   | Rive native library loading    |
          | Volley                                     | Network loading                |

      ## Amortization and R8
      The sizes listed above reflect adding Rive to an otherwise empty application. Some of the above dependencies may already be present in your application, and so do not contribute to the size increase when adding Rive. For example, if your app already uses Jetpack Compose, the Compose dependencies will likely already be included in your app's binary.

      The same is true for the C++ standard library, which will be shared across all dependencies with native code.

      Additionally, when compiling a release build, R8 will minify your application, removing unused code and resources. This can further reduce the size impact of adding Rive to your application. Ensure your Gradle file contains `isMinifyEnabled = true`.

      ## Future Work
      There are options available to reduce the binary size of the library that can be considered for future work, including:
        - Replacing Miniaudio with Oboe for audio support
          - Currently Miniaudio can be removed by [compiling Rive Android yourself](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android#no-audio-engine), using the `-PnoAudio` Gradle flag
        - Modularizing the runtime to allow including Compose support only when needed, and separating the Compose API from the Legacy API
        - Making Volley an opt-in dependency for network loading
        - Changing C++ compile flags to prefer size over speed (requires performance testing)
