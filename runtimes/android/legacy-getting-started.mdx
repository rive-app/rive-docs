## Adding Rive to Your Project
See the [Adding Rive to Your Project](./android#adding-rive-to-your-project) section for instructions on adding Rive to your Android project. Once complete, resume here.

## Building a RiveAnimationView

There are a number of ways to add Rive animations to your Android application.

Before getting started, ensure your Rive files (.riv) are included in your Android project. The recommended way is to add them to the raw resources (`res/raw`) folder of your project.

### Using setRiveResource or setRiveUrl

For the simplest programmatic initialization, use `setRiveResource` (local) or `setRiveUrl` (networked) methods. They have a number of optional parameters to customize the view.

```kotlin
class MyActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val riveView = RiveAnimationView(this)
        riveView.setRiveResource(R.raw.my_rive_file)
        // or
        riveView.setRiveUrl("https://mycdn.myorg.com/my_rive_file.riv")

        setContentView(riveView)
    }
}
```

### Using RiveAnimationView.Builder

Rive also provides a builder pattern for constructing a `RiveAnimationView` which allows for staggered initialization steps. Note that the `setResource` method can take a raw resource ID, a URL (string), a byte array, or a Rive `File`.

```kotlin
val riveView = RiveAnimationView.Builder(this)
    .setResource(R.raw.my_rive_file)
    // or
    .setResource("https://mycdn.myorg.com/my_rive_file.riv")
    .build()

setContentView(riveView)
```

### Using a Rive File

If you have already loaded a Rive `File` instance, you can use that to initialize the view as well. See [Caching a Rive File](../caching-a-rive-file) for more details on how and why to load Rive files.

```kotlin
// Loads bytes on the main thread for simplicity; consider loading on a background thread for production use.
val bytes = resources.openRawResource(R.raw.rating).use { res -> res.readBytes() }
val riveFile = File(bytes)
val riveView = RiveAnimationView(this)
riveView.setRiveFile(riveFile)
// Release the file if you no longer need it, keep if you plan to reuse it.
riveFile.release()

setContentView(riveView)
```

### Using Compose (AndroidView)
You can also use `RiveAnimationView` inside a Compose UI using the `AndroidView` composable. See also the [LegacyComposeActivity](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/rive/runtime/example/LegacyComposeActivity.kt) in the example app.

```kotlin
setContent {
    AndroidView(
        factory = { context ->
            RiveAnimationView(context).also {
                it.setRiveResource(R.raw.my_rive_file)
            }
        }
    )
}
```

### Using XML Layouts

To use XML, include it as part of your layout. It has a number of optional attributes to customize the view.

```xml
<app.rive.runtime.kotlin.RiveAnimationView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:riveResource="@raw/my_rive_file"
    ... />
```

If you would rather load the Rive file from a hosted location, use the `app:riveUrl` attribute. Ensure you have the necessary [internet permissions](#internet-permissions).

```xml
<app.rive.runtime.kotlin.RiveAnimationView
    app:riveUrl="https://mycdn.myorg.com/my_rive_file.riv"
    ... />
```

From your activity you can load it as usual:

```kotlin
setContentView(R.layout.my_layout)
```

## Internet Permissions

If you're retrieving Rive files over a network, your app will need permission to access the internet in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

Note that this isn't necessary if you include the .riv files in your Android project and load them as raw resources.

See the pages in the "Runtime Fundamentals" section to learn how to control animation playback, state machines, and more.
