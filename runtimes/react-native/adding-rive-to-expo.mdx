title: "Adding Rive to Expo"
description: "Rive React Native Expo. "
---

To use Rive with Expo, you'll need to install the Rive React Native package.

Because this package contains custom native code, it's not compatible with Expo Go. Instead, you'll need to use a development build, which gives you full access to native modules.

<Note>
  Development builds are the [recommended setup for production
  apps](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/expo-go-usage.md).
</Note>

This guide will walk you through integrating Rive into your Expo project, including installing dependencies, configuring your build, and testing your graphics.

## Initial Setup

If you don’t already have a project, create a new Expo app:

```bash
npx create-expo-app MyRiveApp
```

Install the Expo development client:

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

Then install the Rive package:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Runtime (Recommended)">
    
  ```bash
  npx expo install @rive-app/react-native
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Legacy Runtime">

```bash
npx expo install rive-react-native
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## iOS Minimum Version

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Runtime (Recommended)">
    The new runtime requires iOS **15.1** or later.

If you’re using Expo SDK 52 or later, as it already requires `15.1` or later.

If you're using an older SDK, you’ll need to update your iOS deployment target manually or via configuration.

### Option 1: Using `expo-build-properties` (Recommended)

    [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) simplifies app maintenance and configuration by automatically generating your iOS and Android native projects using [Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/#usage).

    If you're using CNG, you can set the minimum iOS deployment target directly in your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "15.1"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you’re not using Prebuild, update the target directly in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, podfile_properties['ios.deploymentTarget'] || '15.1'
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Legacy Runtime">
    The legacy runtime requires iOS **14.0** or later.

    If you're using Expo SDK 52 or later, you can skip this step as it has a higher default.

    If you're using an older SDK, you'll need to update your iOS deployment target manually or via configuration.

    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": [
          [
            "expo-build-properties",
            {
              "ios": {
                "deploymentTarget": "14.0"
              }
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Option 2: Manual Configuration

    If you're not using Prebuild, update the target directly in your `ios/Podfile`:

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, podfile_properties['ios.deploymentTarget'] || '14.0'
    ```

  </Tab>

## Creating a Development Build

To run your app with the Rive runtime, you’ll need to create a development build.

Since there are several ways to do this, refer to the [Expo development builds guide](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) to choose the method that best suits your needs.

## Running Your App

Once you've created a development build and installed it on your device or simulator, start your app with:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can use the following component to test Rive:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Runtime (Recommended)">
    ```tsx
    import { View, ActivityIndicator, Text } from "react-native";
    import { RiveView, useRiveFile, Fit } from "@rive-app/react-native";

    export default function RiveDemo() {
      const { riveFile, isLoading, error } = useRiveFile(
        "https://public.rive.app/community/runtime-files/2195-4346-avatar-pack-use-case.riv"
      );

      if (isLoading) {
        return (
          <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
            <ActivityIndicator size="large" />
          </View>
        );
      }

      if (error || !riveFile) {
        return (
          <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
            <Text>Error loading Rive file: {error || "Unknown error"}</Text>
          </View>
        );
      }

      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
          <RiveView
            file={riveFile}
            artboardName="Avatar 1"
            stateMachineName="avatar"
            fit={Fit.Contain}
            style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
            autoPlay={true}
          />
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      If you encounter errors loading the Rive file, make sure you're running in a development build and not Expo Go.
    </Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Legacy Runtime">
    ```js
    import { View } from "react-native";
    import Rive from "rive-react-native";

    export default function RiveDemo() {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: "center", justifyContent: "center" }}>
          <Rive
            url="https://public.rive.app/community/runtime-files/2195-4346-avatar-pack-use-case.riv"
            artboardName="Avatar 1"
            stateMachineName="avatar"
            style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
          />
        </View>
      );
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      If you encounter this error: `Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent:
      "RiveReactNativeView" was not found in the UIManager`, it usually means the
      app is running in **Expo Go**. Press `s` in your terminal and select the
      development build instead.
    </Note>

  </Tab>

## Adding Local Assets

The example above loads a `.riv` file from a remote URL.
To use local `.riv` files, they must be bundled into your native build.
See [Loading in Rive Files](/runtimes/react-native/loading-rive-files) for instructions on working with local assets.
