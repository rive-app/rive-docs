title: 'Adding Rive to Expo'
description: 'Rive React Native Expo. '
---

To use Rive with Expo, you'll need to install the `rive-react-native` package.

Because this package contains custom native code, it's not compatible with Expo Go. Instead, you'll need to use a development build, which gives you full access to native modules.

> **Note:**
> Development builds are the [recommended setup for production apps](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/expo-go-usage.md).

This guide will walk you through integrating Rive into your Expo project, including installing dependencies, configuring your build, and testing your animations.

## Initial Setup

If you don’t already have a project, create a new Expo app:

```bash
npx create-expo-app MyRiveApp
```

Install the Expo development client:

```bash
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

Then install the Rive package:

```bash
npx expo install rive-react-native
```

## iOS Minimum Version

Rive for iOS requires a minimum deployment target of `14.0`.

If you’re using Expo SDK 52 or later, you can skip this step as `14.0` is already the default.

If you're using an older SDK, you’ll need to update your iOS deployment target manually or via configuration.

### Option 1: Using `expo-build-properties` (Recommended)

[Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) simplifies app maintenance and configuration by automatically generating your iOS and Android native projects using [Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/#usage).

If you're using CNG, you can set the minimum iOS deployment target directly in your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "deploymentTarget": "14.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you’re not using Prebuild, update the target directly in your `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, podfile_properties['ios.deploymentTarget'] || '14.0'
```

## Creating a Development Build

To run your app with the Rive runtime, you’ll need to create a development build.

Since there are several ways to do this, refer to the [Expo development builds guide](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) to choose the method that best suits your needs.

## Running Your App

Once you've created a development build and installed it on your device or simulator, start your app with:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can use the following component to test Rive:

```js
import { View } from 'react-native';
import Rive from 'rive-react-native';

export default function RiveDemo() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Rive
        url="https://public.rive.app/community/runtime-files/2195-4346-avatar-pack-use-case.riv"
        artboardName="Avatar 1"
        stateMachineName="avatar"
        style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

> **Note:**
> If you encounter this error:
> `Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RiveReactNativeView" was not found in the UIManager`,
> it usually means the app is running in **Expo Go**. Press `s` in your terminal and select the development build instead.

## Adding Local Assets

The example above loads a `.riv` file from a remote URL.
To use local `.riv` files, they must be bundled into your native build.
See [Loading in Rive Files](loading-rive-to-expo) for instructions on working with local assets.
