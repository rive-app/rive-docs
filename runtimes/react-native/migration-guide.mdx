## Migrating from 8.x.x to 9.x.x

This release updates the underlying [Rive Android](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android) runtime from v9.x.x to v10.x.x, which includes the following changes:
- The [Rive Renderer](https://rive.app/blog/rive-renderer-now-open-source-and-available-on-all-platforms) is now the default renderer on Android. For iOS, the Rive Renderer was already the default. 
- Removal of the Skia renderer for Android. For iOS Skia was removed in v8.0.0
- Support for Feathering
- Smaller APK sizes and improved performance on Android

### Breaking Changes

With the removal of the Skia renderer, the `Skia` option has been removed from the `RiveRendererAndroid` enum.

This change is only relevant if you are manually specifying the renderer in your code. For more details, refer to [Choosing a Renderer](/runtimes/choose-a-renderer/overview).

No other API changes are required.
