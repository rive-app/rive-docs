## Overview

This guide documents how to get started using the React Native runtime library. Rive runtime libraries are open-source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react-native). This library contains an API for React Native apps to easily integrate Rive assets.

The minimum iOS target is **14.0**

<Note>
 See [our documentation](./adding-rive-to-expo) to add Rive to an Expo app.
</Note>

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below for a quick start on integrating Rive into your React Native app.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the dependency">
    ```bash
    npm install rive-react-native
    # or for Yarn
    yarn add rive-react-native
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="iOS - Pod Install">
    `cd` inside the `ios` folder and run `pod install` (if deploying to iOS)

    <Note>
    If you run into issues here, you may need to bump the `ios` deployment version target to at least `14.0`. You can find this version in the `Podfile` of the `ios/` folder.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Android - Set Kotlin Dependency Resolution">
    This step may be optional - however, if your Android setup in the React Native project does not have Kotlin `v1.8.0+` set up, you may run into duplicate class issues when building the project. To mitigate these issues, as suggested by [Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle-configure-project.html#versions-alignment-of-transitive-dependencies), add the following to your dependencies in your application's `build.gradle` file to deal with version alignment:

    ```javascript
    dependencies {
        implementation platform('org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom:1.8.0')
        ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Rive component">
    ```javascript
    import Rive from 'rive-react-native';

    function App() {
      return <Rive
          url="https://public.rive.app/community/runtime-files/2195-4346-avatar-pack-use-case.riv"
          artboardName="Avatar 1"
          stateMachineName="avatar"
          style={{width: 400, height: 400}}
      />;
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
