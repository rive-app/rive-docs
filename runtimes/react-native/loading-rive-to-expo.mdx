description: 'How to use Rive files with the Rive React Native runtime. '
---

There are several ways to include Rive files in your React Native projects:

- Option 1: URL where a Rive file is hosted
- Option 2: Add the asset to the asset bundles of the native iOS and Android projects
- Option 3: Add the asset to the asset bundles in an Expo project using `expo-asset`
- Option 4: Source prop and require

When you render the `<Rive />` component, you must supply the `url` or `resourceName` prop respectively to the options above, or your component will fail to load.

Read more below to see more on each of the options.

### Option 1: URL

```javascript
<Rive
  url="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv"
/>;
```

When using the Rive React Native runtime to load in a Rive file, one option is to reference the URL where the Rive file may be hosted (i.e AWS S3 bucket, Google Storage, etc.). This can be done via the `url` parameter when instantiating the `<Rive />` component.

### Option 2: Asset Bundle

```javascript
<Rive
  resourceName="weather_app" // weather_app.riv
/>;
```

Another alternative to loading in a Rive file for the `<Rive />` component is to reference the name of the resource/asset in the respective `ios/` and `android/` projects.

#### Adding to iOS

In the `ios/` folder of your React Native project, open the `.xcodeproj` file in XCode. This will open up the native iOS project.

Create a *New Group* under the root of this project and name it whatever asset folder name you'd like to give it (i.e., *Assets*). Drop your `.riv` file into this group, and when prompted by XCode, add it to the *Target* of your app. This ensures that the Rive file gets included in the bundle resources.

#### Adding to Android 

In the `android/` folder of your React Native project, open the whole folder in Android Studio. This will open up the Android project.

Under the `/app/src/main/res/` directory, create a new *Android Resource Directory*, which is where you'll store Rive file assets, and when prompted to select a name for the folder and resource type, select `raw` from the resource type dropdown. Drop your `.riv` file into this new folder; this ensures that the Rive file gets included in the bundle resources.

Adding `weather_app.riv` to the Android project

Once the Rive files are added to the asset/resource bundles of the iOS and Android projects in the React Native app, you should be free to start referencing the name of the file (without the `.riv` extension) when creating the `<Rive />` component, using that `resourceName` prop.

### Option 3: Using expo-asset with Expo CNG

```javascript
<Rive
  resourceName="weather_app" // weather_app.riv
/>;
```

If you're using Expo SDK 53 or later and want to take advantage of [Expo CNG (Continuous Native Generation)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/), you can use the [expo-asset plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/asset/) to bundle your `.riv` files into your native builds.

In your `app.json` or `app.config.js`, add the `expo-asset` plugin and specify your `.riv` files or asset directories:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-asset",
        {
          "assets": ["path/to/file.riv", "path/to/directory"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

Then run `npx expo prebuild` to get your Rive files bundled into your development builds before restarting your project.

If you're using an earlier version of Expo, you can find an alternative approach in [this Github Issue](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react-native/issues/185).

### Option 4: Source Prop with Require

```javascript
<Rive
  source={require('./flying_car.riv')}
/>;
```

If you prefer to keep your Rive files in the same folder as your component code, you can use the `source` prop with `require()` to load the Rive file by referencing its path.
An additional advantage of this method is that during development, the file is served by the Metro development server, allowing you to update it without rebuilding your app.
When you build your app, the file is automatically bundled into the appâ€™s assets.
