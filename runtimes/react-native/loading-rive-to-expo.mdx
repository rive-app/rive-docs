There are two ways to include Rive files in your React Native projects:

- Option 1: URL where a Rive file is hosted
- Option 2: Add the asset to the asset bundles of the native iOS and Android projects

When you render the `<Rive />` component, you must supply the `url` or `resourceName` prop respectively to the options above, or your component will fail to load.

Read more below to see more on each of the options.

### Option 1: URL

```javascript
<Rive
  url="https://cdn.rive.app/animations/vehicles.riv"
/>;
```

When using the Rive React Native runtime to load in a RIve file, one option is to reference the URL where the Rive file may be hosted (i.e AWS S3 bucket, Google Storage, etc.). This can be done via the `url` parameter when instantiating the `<Rive />` component.

### Option 2: Asset Bundle

```javascript
<Rive
  resourceName="weather_app" // weather_app.riv
/>;
```

Another alternative to loading in a Rive file for the `<Rive />` component is to reference the name of the resource/asset in the respective `ios/` and `android/` projects.

#### Adding to iOS

In the `ios/` folder of your React Native project, open the `.xcodeproj` file in XCode. This will open up the native iOS project.

Create a *New Group* under the root of this project and name it whatever asset folder name you'd like to give it (i.e., *Assets*). Drop your `.riv` file into this group, and when prompted by XCode, add it to the *Target* of your app. This ensures that the Rive file gets included in the bundle resources.

#### Adding to Android 

In the `android/` folder of your React Native project, open the whole folder in Android Studio. This will open up the Android project.

Under the `/app/src/main/res/` directory, create a new *Android Resource Directory*, which is where you'll store Rive file assets, and when prompted to select a name for the folder and resource type, select `raw` from the resource type dropdown. Drop your `.riv` file into this new folder; this ensures that the Rive file gets included in the bundle resources.

Adding `weather_app.riv` to the Android project

Once the Rive files are added to the asset/resource bundles of the iOS and Android projects in the React Native app, you should be free to start referencing the name of the file (without the `.riv` extension) when creating the `<Rive />` component, using that `resourceName` prop.
