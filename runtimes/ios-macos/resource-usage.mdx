When comparing resource usage between Rive and other libraries, you may encounter differences in CPU and memory usage.

An important note is that Rive uses Metal APIs directly over other APIs and frameworks like Core Animation to be able to adjust its usage for best performance with Rive.

<Note>Lottie is an example of a library that uses Core Animation.</Note>

For libraries using Core Animation, logic and rendering is managed in a separate process, the "Render Server" (`backboardd`). In doing so, CPU and memory usage isn't reported by the app process itself, and instead is reported by `backboardd`. 

Xcode and Instruments may show lower CPU usage because Xcode and Instruments by default show stats for the process it is monitoring (and attached to). In most cases, this is the app that is running. CPU usage for libraries using Core Animation will appear in a separate process (`backboardd`), which Xcode and Instruments are not monitoring by default.

Rive may also show more memory being used by the app process, again because of the difference in which iOS APIs are used and how they are used - Rive uses Metal directly, while other libraries commonly use Core Animation. As mentioned above, Core Animation “offloads” some work to the "Render Server", and as such, any rendering-related memory allocations will appear in `backboardd`.

The difference in both CPU and memory usage can be found when profiling the `backboardd` process. This can be seen by using the “Activity Monitor” Instruments template, and filtering by your app process and the `backboardd` processes. Comparing CPU and memory when using Rive vs other libraries, you should see that under some conditions the total amount of system memory used when using Rive is less; but, since Rive uses Metal directly, CPU usage and memory allocations appear in the app process.
