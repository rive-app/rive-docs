## Overview

This guide documents how to get started using the iOS/macOS runtime library. Rive runtime libraries are open-source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios).

This library contains an API for iOS/macOS apps to easily integrate their Rive assets for both UIKit/AppKit and SwiftUI. The runtime can also be installed via Cocoapods or Swift Package Manager.

The minimum iOS target is **14.0,** and the target for macOS is `13.1`

<Note>
 **Note:** macOS runtime support is included in `v4.0.1+`
</Note>

## Example App

You can run our iOS/macOS example app from the Rive GitHub repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios
```

Open the `Example-iOS` app in XCode and be sure to select the `Preview (iOS)` or `Preview (macOS)` [scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project). The other schemes are for development purposes and require additional configuration, see[ ](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)[CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below for a quick start on integrating Rive into your iOS/macOS app.

### 1. Install the dependency

#### Via Cocoapods

Add the following to your Podspec file:

```bash
  pod 'RiveRuntime'
```

#### Via Swift Package Manager 

To install via Swift Package Manager, in the package finder in Xcode, search for `rive-ios` or the full Github path: `https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios`

### 2. Importing Rive 

Add the following to the top of your file where you utilize the Rive runtime:

```bash
import RiveRuntime
```

### 3. v2 Runtime Usage

In Rive iOS runtimes of versions 2.x.x or later, the primary object you'll use is a `RiveViewModel`. It is responsible for creating and interacting with Rive assets.

#### 3a. SwiftUI

**Set up RiveViewModel w/ View**

```javascript
struct AnimationView: View {
    var body: some View {
        RiveViewModel(fileName: "cool_rive_animation").view()
    }
}
```

In the above example, you reference the name of a `.riv` asset bundled into your application, but you can also load in a `.riv` file hosted on a remote URL like so:

```javascript
struct AnimationView: View {
    var body: some View {
        RiveViewModel(
            webURL: "https://cdn.rive.app/animations/off_road_car_v7.riv"
        ).view()
    }
}
```

#### 3b. UIKit - Storyboard

#### Set up RiveViewModel w/ Controller formatted on a Storyboard

The simplest way of adding Rive to a controller using Storyboards is to make a `RiveViewModel`, and set its view to be the `RiveView` you made in the Storyboard.

```javascript
class AnimationViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var riveView: RiveView!
    var simpleVM = RiveViewModel(fileName: "cool_rive_animation")

    override public func viewDidLoad() {
        simpleVM.setView(riveView)
    }
}
```

#### 3c. UIKit - Programmatic 

#### Set up RiveViewModel w/ Controller from scratch in code

You can also add Rive to a controller purely with code by making the `RiveViewModel`, telling it to create a fresh `RiveView` and then adding it to the view hierarchy.

```javascript
class AnimationViewController: UIViewController {
    var simpleVM = RiveViewModel(fileName: "cool_rive_animation")
    
    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        let riveView = simpleVM.createRiveView()
        view.addSubview(riveView)
        riveView.frame = view.bounds
    }
}
```
