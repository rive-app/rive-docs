<Warning>
 On web, some browsers restrict audio from playing until the web page is interacted with. This applies to any audio, not just Rive audio.<br/>
 The web page needs to receive some interaction (touch/click) before sound is played. This interaction can be anything on the browser and doesn't need to be a Rive specific interaction.
</Warning> 
## Embedded Assets

Embedded assets require no additional work to play audio. However, on some platforms, additional work may be required to set up audio to mix, duck, or otherwise change more global settings for playing audio. See **Audio Settings** below.

## Referenced Assets

Referenced assets require a little bit more work to play audio. Audio will still automatically play, but the audio file(s) must be loaded when a Rive runtime attempts to play audio. For more information, see [Loading Assets](./loading-assets).

    ```swift IOS

    let viewModel = RiveViewModel(fileName: "my_rive_file") { asset, data, factory -> Bool in
        guard let audioAsset = asset as? RiveAudioAsset else {

    ## Audio Settings

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Apple">
        On iOS, playing audio will respect your `AVAudioSession` shared instance settings. For more information, see [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession) on `AVAudioSession`. Using this, you can choose to mix audio, duck audio, and more. You can update your shared instance early in your app lifecycle if you would like to ensure all Rive audio plays  with the correct settings.
        ```swift IOS
        // Example: Ignore the silent switch, and mix with other audio
        let category: AVAudioSession.Category = .playback
        let options: AVAudioSession.CategoryOptions = [.mixWithOthers]
        AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(category, options: options)
        ```
    </Tab>

## Setting Volume

An artboard is capable of setting its volume. A parent artboard will set the volume of all nested artboards; however, setting a nested artboard's volume will **not** update the parent's volume.

```swift IOS
// Set the current artboard's volume to 50%
let viewModel = RiveViewModel(fileName: "my_rive_file")
viewModel.riveModel?.volume = 0.5
```
