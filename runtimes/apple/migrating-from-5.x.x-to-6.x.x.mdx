## Rive Renderer

### RendererType

`riveRenderer` is now the new default renderer type, and `skiaRenderer` has been removed. If you were previously explicitly setting the renderer type to Skia, then you will have to [specify a new renderer](/runtimes/choose-a-renderer/), or use the new default Rive Renderer (our recommendation).

## Package Size

Rive's iOS runtime is now \~57% smaller, at \~3.3mb, compared to \~7.6mb prior to v6.0.0.
