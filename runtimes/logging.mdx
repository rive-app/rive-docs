Some Rive runtimes include logging capabilities to help with debugging. These logs are *only* for debugging purposes; nothing is sent over the network, and no personally identifiable information (PII) is logged. The table below showcases the runtimes that support logging.

        ### Swift

        ```
        RiveLogger.isEnabled = true // Enable logging; false by default
        RiveLogger.levels = [.debug] // Filter logs; all by default
        RiveLogger.categories = [.viewModel] // Filter categories; all by default
        RiveLogger.isVerbose = true // Include verbose logs; false by default
        ```

        ### Levels 

        Logs will be logged at various levels, which are similar to those of `OSLogType` . These levels can be used to additionally filter logs to be logged at certain levels only. Available levels are:

        - Debug: most commonly used, to aid with debugging
        - Info: logs that provide additional information
        - Default: the default log level; however, many logs are `debug` level
        - Error: used when an error occurs
        - Fault: used when a critical (fatal) error occurs

        ### Categories 

        Logs are split by categories; individual portions of the runtime are split into separate logs to support filtering. Available categories are:

        - State machine: operations that occur within an active state machine, such as receiving events
        - Artboard: operations that occur within an active artboard, such as advancing (verbose)
        - View model: operations that occur within a loaded `RiveViewModel` , such as triggering / setting inputs
        - Model: operations that occur within a loaded `RiveModel` , such as setting state machines / artboards
        - File: operations that occur within a loaded `RiveFile`, such as asset loading
        - View: operations that occur within a `RiveView`, such as player events (play / pause / stop / reset)

        ### Verbose Logs 

        Certain logs are verbose, meaning they will stream logs consistently. Examples of these logs are view advances, and drawing validation. Verbose logs are disabled by default; see above for how to enable verbose logging.
