description: 'Share Links are a fast no-code way to get your Rive files running on a website or to present your graphics to a client.'
---

Share the current version of the file you're working with share links. Note that this is not the same as giving someone access to the live file with all its revision history. This link will be a frozen version of the file in its current state. If you make changes to the file, you'll need to generate a new share link. 

<Warning>
Certain features, such as Feathers, are only supported through the Rive Renderer. See our [Feature Support](/runtimes/features-support) page for more information.
</Warning>

## Creating a share link

Generate a share link from the Export menu. This link can be shared with anyone, not just your team members.

Choose which artboard, animation, or state machine you want to share in the Share Link modal.

### Share link options

Once you click on the "Generate link" button, several share link types appear:

- **Share link** - Displayed within a border frame on the Rive site at a unique URL. Use this for quickly showing off your Rive creation to clients without having to stage it within the context of a web application yourself
- **Embed link** - Standalone display of your Rive creation without the context of the border frame. Use this link when you want to embed your Rive creation into other 3rd party platforms that support unfurling and displaying your Rive creation still as a preview (i.e Notion, Tome, Telegram)
- **Embed code** - A code snippet that allows you to embed your Rive creation's embed link in an iframe. This is useful for where you need to drop Rive into a platform where you can edit HTML (i.e Webflow, WordPress, etc.) and you don't want to deal with setting up the creation with a web runtime
- **Framer code (Deprecated)** - See the new official [Rive Framer Plugin](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/plugins/rive/). A code snippet specifically for embedding Rive into [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) sites. Pasting this into a new Framer component gives you several options for controlling Rive files, such as layout configuration, animation playback, and state machine input control. See the [Framer and Rive subpage](./framer-and-rive) for more on how to use Framer code snippets.

Other options include:
- **Enable**: Disable the link to prevent others from viewing it.
- **Rive Renderer**: Toggle between using the Rive Renderer (recommended) and the Canvas renderer.

<Note>Certain features, such as Feathers, are only available using the Rive Renderer.</Note>

## Integrations

Use share links to embed your Rive files with other well-known tools and platforms! This is not a full list. Most tools will support Rive share links using the methods described here.

### Framer

<Warning> The Framer component code snippet is deprecated. You can now use the official [Rive Framer Plugin](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/plugins/rive/) to more easily integrate Rive graphics into Framer</Warning>

You can use the Framer component code snippet when creating a share link; no custom code is needed. With this integration, you copy our code snippet for your specified artboard and animation/state machine and paste it into a new [Framer code component](https://www.framer.com/learn/code-components/). With this new component, you can drag and drop it into your page and control playback, layout, and even state machine usage.

See the [Framer and Rive subpage](./framer-and-rive) to find more details and examples.
