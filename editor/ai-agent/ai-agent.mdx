Rive's AI agent helps you write code, design, and animate. Generate scripts, responsive layouts, data models, and even animation.

## Getting Started

Open the **Agent panel** from the left sidebar and type a prompt describing what you want.

**Example prompt:**

> Create a script that draws a rounded rectangle.
> Width, height, color, and corner radius should be inputs.
> When the inputs change, the drawing should update.

The Agent will respond with:

- A summary of what it changed
- Any new scripts it created
- Explanations for how the script works
- Suggestions for how to customize it

If a new script is generated, you’ll find it in your Assets panel.

## Toolbar

Use the AI Agent toolbar to manage your conversations:
