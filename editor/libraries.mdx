## Introduction
Libraries facilitate the sharing of [components](editor/fundamentals/components) and their view models across Rive files. In the past, you may have relied on nested artboards and copy-paste workflows to share elements. This works for individuals, but breaks down at scale: exports bloat, versions drift, and teams lose track of changes.

Libraries provide:

- Components can be published and reused across project files.
- Updates flow downstream with version history and change notifications.
- Teams can collaborate without worrying about mismatched assets.
- Explicit contracts: Authors decide which properties can vary by exposing them via View Models. Consumers use those without touching the underlying complexity.
- Updatability: Components evolve over time. Consumers can pin to a specific version or update when ready.
- Detachment: If a component no longer fits, you can detach it. It becomes a local copy and no longer listens for library updates.


## Creating a Library
Any file can be made into a library. First, you'll need to create a [component](editor/fundamentals/components) and/or a view model before you can publish a file as a library. Select an artboard on the stage and use the component icon in the inspector or `Shift` + `N` to toggle its status as a component.

With a component or view model present in the file, select the Publish Library option via the export action on the toolbar, or via the file menu. The publishing panel provides an oppoetuiry to select which of the components, view models, and enums you'd like to be published as part of the library.

You can identify a library file by the icon in the tab bar and in the file browser.

## Importing from a Library
To start using components and view models from a published library, select the library icon present in both the asset and data panels. The library panel displays alongside the hierarchy/asset/data column, and displays a list of the available libraries for the open file. Currently, a Rive file can only access libraries contained within the same project. Cross-project — or workspace — libraries are coming soon. Furthermore, we also plan to introduce public libraries soon after that.

Selecting a library listed in the panel will present its available components, view models, and enums. Choose the elements you'd like to add to your file, and use the Add to File action in the inspector to add them to your assets.

Note: You can use the version dropdown to browse previous iterations of libraries and their components.

With the chosen elements added to your file, you can access and reuse components via the asset and data panels. Elements sourced from a library can be identifed by the library icon in the bottom-right corner of the regular icon.

## Unpublishing a Library
Use the Unpublish Library action in the file menu to prevent other files from continuing to access the library and it's components. Any components that were already imported before the library was unpublished will still be accessible to the host file. Unpublishing will only prevent the library from being accessible any further. You may also republish a library at any time.
