The Rive Editor has two distinct modes, Design and Animate. Switching between modes changes the interface to show the appropriate tools and options. 

## Design Mode 

Use Design Mode to prepare your graphics for animation. This is where you can design your own graphics with Rive's [tools](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/toolbar/docC0WckDcbf), [import graphics from other software](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/importing-assets/docO2hh4U88G), or rig your graphics with [bones](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/bones/docYyQwxrgI5), [transform spaces](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/transform-spaces/docTXtRE0QWP), and [constraints](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/contraints-overview/doc6IsrpI9ZE).

 Design Mode is the default mode for any file that doesn't have any animations created. The mode exists because Rive allows you to attach multiple animations to a single artboard, so you need a place to set up and create those graphics.

## Animate Mode

Use [Animate Mode](../animate-mode/) to create all of the animations and [State Machine](../state-machine/) for your artboard.

When you switch to Animate Mode, the UI updates to display a timeline with a list of animations for the currently [active artboard](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/artboards/docYyi4AbIjL)[.](https://app.outverse.com/rive/doc/artboards/docYyi4AbIjL) The Inspector also updates to show key buttons next to any property that can be animated.
