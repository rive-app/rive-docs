description: 'The Rive Editor has two distinct modes, Design and Animate. Switching between modes changes the interface to show the appropriate tools and options.'

## Design Mode 

Use Design Mode to prepare your graphics for animation. This is where you can design your own graphics with Rive's [tools](../interface-overview/toolbar), [import graphics from other software](./importing-assets), or rig your graphics with [bones](../manipulating-shapes/bones), [transform spaces](./transform-spaces), and [constraints](../constraints/).

 Design Mode is the default mode for any file that doesn't have any animations created. The mode exists because Rive allows you to attach multiple animations to a single artboard, so you need a place to set up and create those graphics.

## Animate Mode

Use [Animate Mode](../animate-mode/) to create all of the animations and [State Machine](../state-machine/) for your artboard.

When you switch to Animate Mode, the UI updates to display a timeline with a list of animations for the currently [active artboard](./artboards#active-artboard) The Inspector also updates to show key buttons next to any property that can be animated.
