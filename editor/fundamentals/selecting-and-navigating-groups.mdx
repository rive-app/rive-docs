## Double-click 

Click on a group on the [Stage](../interface-overview/stage) to select it. To select an object in a group, double-click on the object you want to select. This takes you down one level in the hierarchy and allows you to select any object on that level.

You can continue to double-click on other nested groups and shapes to navigate down the [Hierarchy](../interface-overview/hierarchy).

## Enter and Esc shortcuts 

Use the `Enter` key to quickly navigate down the Hierarchy. If a group is selected, you can select the first child quickly.

Use the `Esc` key to quickly navigate up the Hierarchy. This allows you to select the parent of your current selection quickly.

## Deep Select 

Hold `⌘` in macOS or `Ctrl` in Windows, click directly on a shape to select it, no matter where you are in the Hierarchy. This allows you to click through all groups and directly select a shape.
