# Creating a Nested Artboard

To add a new Nested Artboard, use the Nested Artboard tool you can find in the Artboards menu or the shortcut `N`. Once the tool is activated, click anywhere on the desired artboard.

You'll notice at first that your Nested Artboard appears as a group. You'll need to assign an artboard to it using the inspector before it will appear.

# Configuring a Nested Artboard

Once a Nested Artboard has been created, you'll find several configurable options in the Inspector.

## Data Bind

The Data Bind drop-down lets you assign various view model instances to the Nested Artboard.

Note that a View Model can only be assigned to a nested artboard if the View Model has a property from another View Model.

## Artboard Dropdown

The Artboard drop-down lets you switch the Artboard being referenced.

## Mode

The Mode dropdown lets you change how the Nested Artboard will act on the main artboard.

**Node**

Node mode is the default setting for every Nested Artboard. This mode provides no additional sizing option for the artboard outside of its transform properties.

**Leaf**

Leaf mode provides additional Fit and Alignment options for the Nested Artboard. The Fit and Alignment options work to align and fit the artboard to its parent object. For the expected results, you'll want the direct parent of the nested artboard in leaf mode to be either the main artboard or a layout.

**Fit Modes - Fits artboard to parent container**

- Fill
- Contain
- Cover
- Fit Width
- Fit Height
- None
- Scale Down

**Align Modes - Aligns nested artboard to parent container**

- Bottom Center
- Bottom Right
- Bottom Left
- Center
- Center Right
- Center Left
- Top Center
- Top Right
- Top Left

**Layout**

Layout mode forces the parent artboard to treat the nested artboard as a layout. Note that this only works if you've set up layouts at the child level.

## Animations List

While the Mode drop-down lets you change how the nested artboard is affected by the over-all design, the Animations list lets you choose which state machine or individual animations you want the nested artboard to play.

## State Machines

By default, nesting an artboard will automatically attach its default state machine. This state machine comes with all the interactivity, including interactivity using listeners.

If you've exposed any Inputs, you can access them using the options menu (when an animation is selected) or in the Inputs Panel (when a state machine is selected). This is less important now that View Model properties can be used as conditions across all artboards.

## Single Animation

You can playback any animation associated with a Nested Artboard. You'll need to add the desired animation to the Nested Artboard using the plus button. While in most cases it's best to use a state machine to play back an animation, there are cases where you want to play only one or two animations from a nested artboard.

# **Animation Type**

When choosing which animation to use, you have two modes: Simple and Remap.

## **Simple**

A playback type that gives you control of whether the animation is playing, how it mixes with the other animations, and playback speed.\
\
**Playing Toggle**

This toggle dictates whether the animation is playing or not. You can either set this value directly on the animation or key it on a timeline. **Note that a one-shot animation set to Simple cannot be reset.**

**Speed**

The speed setting of the animation controls its playback speed.

**Mix**

The Mix value controls how the animation mixes with any other animation on the Artboard. Mix values set to 100 take priority over every other animation.

When multiple animations have a value set to 100, the animation on top of the list takes priority over those below it.

Note that this mixing only affects animations that share properties.

## Remap

An animation set to the remap type gives you direct control of the time value of an animation.

**Time** - The time value is a keyable property that allows you to remap the time of an animation. This allows you to extend, shrink, or do something completely different with a nested animation.

**Mix** - The Mix value controls how the animation mixes with any other animation on the Artboard. Mix values set to 100 take priority over every other animation.

When multiple animations have a value set to 100, the animation on top of the list takes priority over those below it.

Note that this mixing only affects animations that share properties.
