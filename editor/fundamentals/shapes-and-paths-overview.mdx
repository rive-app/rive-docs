## Shape layer

Vectors in Rive are rendered on shape layers. Shape layers define the style of the shape by allowing you to customize the fill and stroke.

## Path layer

The actual shape of a vector is defined by a path (or multiple paths). Expanding a shape layer in Rive will reveal the paths it's using.

â€ŒYou can add new paths to any shape by dragging and dropping an existing path onto the desired shape layer.

### Path layer properties 

Path layers display properties that to the type of path. Learn more about [Procedural Shapes](../fundamentals/procedural-shapes).

## Enter and Esc shortcuts 

Use the `Enter` key to quickly navigate down the Hierarchy. If you have a shape selected, this allows you to select the child path layer quickly.

Use the `Esc` key to quickly navigate up the Hierarchy. If you have a path selected, this allows you to select the parent shape layer quickly.
