## View a file's history

The Revision History can be accessed from the [Editor Menu](/editor/interface-overview/toolbar).

## Restore a revision

Select a revision to preview it and press the Edit Current Revision button. This copies the selected revision and creates a new entry at the top of the list. This guarantees that even restoring revisions is non-destructive, and you can always go back to the previous version of the file.

From the Editor Menu, select the Create a Revision button. You'll then be prompted to name the revision.
