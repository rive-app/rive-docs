description: "No matter the type of vector you create, you can edit the vertices by changing their position or handles in both design and animate mode."

## Edit Vertices mode

To enter Edit Vertices mode, either select the shape and hit enter twice or select a path and hit enter once.

After activating Edit Vertices mode, you can select any vertex, reposition it, and edit the bezier handles.

### Deep Selection

You may want to select and edit a specific path when dealing with a group of shapes. You can either find that path in the Hierarchy or you can use Deep Selection to select it directly on the Stage.

To select a path within a group on the stage, hold `⌘` (Mac) or `ctrl` (Windows) and click the target path. Alternatively, you can double-click on the path you want to select.

### Path Options

Each path in Edit Vertices mode has a set of path options at the top of the Inspector.


**Done Editing Button**


The Done Editing button can be used to exit Edit Vertices Mode.

**Open Path**

The Open Path button will disconnect the last vertex from the first vertex.

**Reverse Direction**

The Reverse Direction button can be used to reverse the direction of the path. Depending on the Fill-Rule, this can eliminate holes in our shape by changing the mathmatical value of the selected path.

**Convert Radial Corners**

Straight vertices with a corner radius will deform when the scale transform is applied to the shape or path layer. You can convert radial corners from a procedural property to a defined set of vertices. This process will eliminate deformation of the corner.

## Bezier Handles


**‌Straight**

‌The default handles are set to straight, which creates straight edges between vertices.

**Corner Radius**

The Corner Radius property allows you to round straight corners. This property only appears on vertices that are set to straight.

**‌Mirrored**


‌Mirrored is the default handle when you create a vertex by clicking and dragging. These handles always keep the same rotation and length.

**‌Detached‌**

Detached handles allow each handle to have its own rotation and length.

**‌Asymmetric**


‌Asymmetric handles share the same rotation but can have lengths independently of each other.
