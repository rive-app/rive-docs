<Steps>
    <Step title="Add a Distance Constraint to an object">
        Use the Constraints section of the Inspector to add a Distance Constraint to an object.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose a target">
        Use the new constraint's fly-out menu to select a target for this constraint.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Test that the Distance Constraint is working">
        Moving the target object now causes the constrained object to stay close (which is the default mode).

## Strength

The Strength property determines how much the constrained object is affected.

A Strength of 0% means the constraint won't have any effect.

## Distance

The distance that the object will be constrained from the target object. A red constraining circle is drawn on the stage to represent this value.

## Mode 

### Closer 

The owner is constrained closer than the Distance setting. In other words, the owner is constrained inside the constraining sphere.

### Further 

The owner is constrained further than the Distance setting. In other words, the owner is constrained outside the constraining sphere.

### Exactly 

The owner is constrained exactly at the distance of the constraining sphere.
