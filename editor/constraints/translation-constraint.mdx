The Translation Constraint allows you to set limits on an object's position and/or copy the position properties from a target object. These properties can be independently activated.

## How to create a Translation Constraint  

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add a Translation Constraint to an object">
    Use the Constraints section of the Inspector to add a Translation Constraint to an object.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose a target">
    Use the new constraint's fly-out menu to select a target for this constraint.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Test that the Translation Constraint is working">
        Manipulating the target object now causes the constrained object to copy Position properties.

</Steps>

## Strength 

The Strength property determines how much the constrained object is affected.

A Strength of 0% means the constraint won't have any effect.

A Strength of 50% means half the value from the target will be applied.

## Transform Space 

### Source Space 

Choose whether this constraint should use World or Local coordinates for the Source Space.

### Destination Space 

Choose whether this constraint should use World or Local coordinates for the Destination Space.

### Min/Max Space

Choose whether this constraint should use World or Local coordinates for the Min/Max Space.

## Offset 

Allows the constraint owner to be manually offset from the constraint source.

## Copy X &Y 

Allows you to decide if the constraint owner will copy the translation in the X and Y direction. Additionally, use the numerical value to define the rate at which it copies the value.

## Max/Min 

Use the numerical values to define the minimum and maximum limits of the constraint.
