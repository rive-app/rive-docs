<Info>
  We strongly recommend controlling your Rive file through [Data Binding](/editor/data-binding), rather than Inputs. Not only is Data Binding more powerful, it's easier to [control via code at runtime](/runtimes/data-binding).
</Info>

Inputs are a legacy tool to control transitions in our state machine. While Inputs can still be used to control transitions, Data Binding is considered best practice since View Models are both more powerful and easier to control at runtime. 

The best use for Inputs is quick, prototype interactions that you don't plan to migrate to runtime.

### Creating a new Input

To create a new Input, use the plus button in the input panel. After hitting the plus button, youâ€™ll be prompted to select the type of input you want to create. There are three types of inputs; booleans, triggers, and numbers.

## Input Types

We can use three types of inputs depending on the situation and type of interactive content: booleans, triggers, and numbers. We'll discuss each of these inputs below.

### Boolean

A boolean can hold either a true or false value.

### Trigger

Triggers are similar to booleans, but can only become true for a short time.

### Number

A number input give you a number box that can be any integer.
