**Getting started**

You can connect the Rive Editor to AI tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol). The first set of tools are designed let AI handle repetitive tasks, like creating complex View Models, State Machines with hundreds of states/layers, Layouts, Shapes, and more.

This initial iteration works with a limited number of AI tools, specifically those supporting MCP. We recommend using Cursor for now, but the list will expand.

This is initially available in the Early Access version of the Mac Desktop app. Windows support is coming.

**Mac Desktop install process**

1. Install the latest version of the Rive Early Access desktop app for Mac.
2. Create a [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) account and install the app.
3. Download this JSON file.

   mcp.json
4. Open Terminal and type the following commands.
   1. cd .cursor
   2. cp ../Desktop/mcp.json ./
      1. ☝️ This should be the location where you downloaded the JSON file. In this case it’s on the Desktop.
5. Open Cursor and navigate to the settings panel. This can be found in the top right corner.
   1. Navigate to the MCP section.
   2. If everything was installed correctly, you should see Rive as an available MCP server.
   3. Turn the MCP connection On.

Additional information on setting up MCP can be found here: https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol

**What can it do?**

Once Cursor is installed and everything is set up correctly, it’s time to start prompting the AI.

To prompt the AI:

1. Have a Rive File open and an Artboard created.
2. Type your prompt into the chat UI and hit enter. The AI will take a moment to process the request.
   1. Here’s an example prompt, “Create a State Machine about birds with 20 states and 2 layers”
3. Once the request has been processed, type **End Prompt** to allow the AI to make changes to the Rive file.

Supported Features:

- Create State Machines, Layers, States, Transitions, and Conditions
- Create View Models, Properties, and Instances
- Create Layouts
- List View Models
- Create Shapes

Note that this list of features will evolve over time as more tools are added.
