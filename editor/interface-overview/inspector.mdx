# Inspector

An object's editable properties can be found in the Inspector. The Inspector changes dynamically depending on your selected object and where you are in the editor.

## Background Color, Tags, Default Interpolation

When nothing is selected, the Inspector has three sections: Backgrounds, Tags, and Default Interpolation.

**Background color**

Found at the top of the Inspector, this section allows you to change the background color of the editor for both Animate and Design modes. This is a helpful way to remind yourself which mode you are currently in.

**Tags**

Below the background color, you can see, edit, and add new tags to your file. Learn more about tags [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/tagging).

**Default Interpolation**

Below Tags is the Default Interpolation for your file.

When you set a key on the timeline, it will use the file's default interpolation until it's changed on the timeline. By changing the default interpolation, you can control which interpolation curve is applied to new keys.

## Align and Distribute tools

When one or more objects, such as shapes or groups, are selected, the Align tools appear at the top of the inspector. Use them to align or distribute the selected objects. Read more about the Align tools here.

## Layout and N-Slicing

When one or more objects, such as shapes or groups, are selected, the inspector gives the option to layout or n-slice the current selection.

## Transform properties

The transform properties of an object appear below the Align tools. Generally, these properties include position, scale, and rotation, but they can also include width and height if you have a path layer selected.

## Layer properties

Below the transform properties, you'll find several properties that allow you to customize the look of some objects on the stage. These properties include blend mode, opacity, fill, and stroke.
