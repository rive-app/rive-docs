## Editor menu

The Editor menu is located to the left of the Transform Tools menu. This menu gives you access to a number of file level options including revision history, export options, ways to share your file, render options, sounds, and shortcuts.

![Filemenu Pn](/images/filemenu.png)

**Revision History**

Rive automatically saves your revision history. You can view your view or reinstate any instance of your files revision history through the revision history option.

![Revision Pn](/images/revision.png)

Additionally, you can create a new, custom revision using the Create Revision option.

Read more about revision history [here](http://rive.app/docs/editor/fundamentals/revision-history).

**Export**

The export section allows you to both export your Rive file, and export or remove all names for the exported file.

![Export Options Pn](/images/export_Options.png)

Read more about exporting a Rive file and its contents [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-runtime).

**Generate Share Link**

Share Links are a fast no-code way to get your Rive files running on a website or to present your graphics to a client.

![Sharelink Gi](/images/sharelink.gif)

Share the current version of the file you’re working with share links. Note that this is not the same as giving someone access to the live file with all its revision history. This link will be a frozen version of the file in its current state. If you make changes to the file, you’ll need to generate a new share link.

Learn more about share links [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/share-links/overview).

**Publish to Marketplace**

The Marketplace is where you can share files with the entire Rive community.

![Publish Gi](/images/publish.gif)

Learn more about sharing your file to the Marketplace here.

**Cloud Renderer**

The file menu give you a way to both view and add new animation or presets to the render queue.

![Render Pn](/images/render.png)

Learn more about using our Cloud renderer [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/exporting/exporting-for-video-and-static-design).

**Browse Sounds**

Rive allows you to add and play different sound effects in your file through Events. This option allows you to browse through our sound library.

![Sounds Pn](/images/sounds.png)

Read more about adding sound to your Rive file [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/events/audio-events).

**Show Shortcuts**

The Show Shortcuts option allows you to view and search through all shortcuts in the Rive editor.

![Shortcuts Pn](/images/shortcuts.png)

**Documentation**

The Documentation option brings you directly to the Rive documentation.

**Send Feedback**

If you have thoughts on ways for us to improve Rive, the Send Feedback button will link you directly to our Requests page on our Community.


## Transform Tools menu

The Transform Tools menu houses tools that allow you to alter the transform properties of an object on the [Stage](/editor/interface-overview/stage).


![Select Pn](/images/select.png)

**Select Tool**

The Select tool allows you to select objects and manipulate all their transform properties with the gizmo that appears. You can also click and drag in an empty space to select multiple objects with a marquee.

In most cases, you'll probably be using the Select tool, though we also currently offer a dedicated Translate, Scale and Rotation tools.

![Image](/images/editor/interface-overview/5cfc252a-8d52-4751-9064-4c6a1acb6f34.webp)

The gizmo allows you to manipulate the position, rotation, and scale properties of a selection.

**Translate Tool**

The Translate tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the position of your selected object without losing selection.


**Rotate Tool**

The Rotate tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the rotation of your selected object without losing selection.


**Scale Tool**


The Scale tool allows you to click on the gizmo or in an empty space to modify the Scale of your selected object without losing selection.

**Freeze Mode**

Freeze mode allows you to modify the position of origins, groups, and bones without affecting the underlying objects associated with them.

Learn more about Origin and Freeze mode [here](https://rive.app/docs/editor/fundamentals/freeze-and-origin).

## View Options menu

The View options menu allows to control many different view options on the Rive Stage.

![Viewoptions Pn](/images/viewoptions.png)

**Zoom**

This option allows you both view and change the zoom level of the Rive editor.

**Snapping**

The Snapping option allows the Rive editor to help you contextually snap and align objects to one another. This can be disabled by either toggling the option off, or by holding CMD or CTRL while dragging an object.

**Snap to pixel**

Snap to pixel forces the Rive editor to snap an objects position to the nearest half pixel. When disabled, objects can be placed on any fraction of a pixle.

**User Cursors**

When multiple users are present in a file, we are able to visulize their mouse cursor. By disabling this option, we can hide other user cursors in our file.

**Gizmo**

The Gizmo is the visual object on the screen which lets us change the position, scale, or rotation of an object. By disabling this option, the Gizmo will no longer appear when selecting an object.

**Bones**

Disabling the Bones, the editor will hide any bones on the stage.

**Targets**

Disabling Targets will hide any Groups set to Target mode.

**Motion Paths**

When an objects X or Y property is selected on the Timeline a visulization of how the object will move over time appears as a motion path. We can disable this visulization by toggling off this option.

**Joysticks**

Disabling Joysticks will hide any Joysticks on the Stage.

**Events**

Disabling this option will hide any Events on the Stage.

**Layouts**

Layouts inherently have a skeleton visualization on the Stage to see the bounds of a layout container. Disabling this option will hide all visualizations of the layouts on the Stage.

**Layout Animations**

Layouts can automatically animate when various properties of a layout container change. Disabling this option will disable playback of all layout animations.

**Modifier Range**

This option visualizes a Text Modifiers Range when it is within view of the text object. Disabling this option hides the visualization.

**Modifier Range Values**

The Modifier Range Values visualize how the range is applied using little pips below each letter, word, or line. Disabling this option hides the visualization.

**Show Final Playback**

Show Final Playback automatically hides all elements and visualizations that would normally be hidden at runtime. For example, Bones and are not visible at runtime, so with this option enabled, the bones would automatically be hidden when a State Machine or Timeline plays. Disabling this option keeps things like bones visible during playback in the editor. Note that this has no effect at runtime.
