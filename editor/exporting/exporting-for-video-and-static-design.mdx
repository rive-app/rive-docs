Rive is all about interactive animation, but sometimes you need  traditional formats such as MP4, GIF, or PNG sequence. Our Cloud Renderer turns any device into a supercomputer, allowing you to continue working while we generate your video or design file.

# Supported Formats

- H.264
- GIF
- PNG Sequence
- SVG Sequence
- WebM
- PNG
- SVG

# How to render

All rendering is done by creating Rendering Presets, then adding those Render Presets to the Render Que.

## Creating a preset

With the Artboard selected, you'll find the Render Presets option. Hitting the plus button will create a new Render Preset. This can be done from either Design or Animate mode.

By creating a Render Preset in Design Mode you'll have the option to render either an SVG or PNG. This option can be changed using the dropdown menu with the preset selected.

By creating a Render Preset in Animate Mode you'll have the option to render a number of video formats including  H.264, GIF, PNG/SVG sequence, and WebM. This option can be changed using the dropdown menu with the preset selected.

To the left of the Render Preset name, you'll find additional options which allow you to change a number of options.

- Animation
- Format
- FPS
- Duration
- Bit rate
- Size

## Adding a Preset to the Render Queue 

When you're finished creating a preset, you'll need to add it to the Render Queue.

Do this by either using the Queue All button below the Render Presets, or by finding the Add to Render Queue option within a Render Preset.

Once you've added an item to the Render, you'll see that a new window appears. This window is the Render Queue. From here, you can change rendering options, as well as begin the rendering process.

You can always find the Renderer via the File Menu.\
\
To begin rendering an animation, use the play button next to the preset name, or hit the double play button at the top of the Render Queue.

Once you're file  is finished rendering, you'll be able to download it from the Completed tab within the Cloud Renderer.
