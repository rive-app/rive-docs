Exporting a file for backup is useful when you want a hard copy of your file saved to your device, if you are looking to transfer a file from one user to another, or you're trying to send in a file for a support ticket. Unlike files exported for runtime (.riv), files exported for backup (.rev) contain all of the information that is typically stripped from the file.\
\
 To export a file for backup, you can either do this from the file browser, or from the file menu when the file is open.

## Exporting from the file browser 

To export a backup file from the file browser, first, find the file that you want to download.

Next, right click on the file and choose whether you want to download the file backup, or you can choose to download a specific revision of the file.

## Exporting from the file menu 

To export a backup file, when the file is open, first, click on the file menu. Next, find the export option and select "for backup".
