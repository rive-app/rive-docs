Exporting a file for backup is useful when you want a hard copy of your file saved to your device, if you are looking to transfer a file from one user to another, or you're trying to send in a file for a support ticket. Unlike files exported for runtime (.riv), files exported for backup (.rev) contain all of the information that is typically stripped from the file.\
\
 To export a file for backup, you can either do this from the file browser, or from the file menu when the file is open.

## Exporting from the file browser
