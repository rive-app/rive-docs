title: 'Layout Animation'
description: 'Add animation to a layout container to define how it interpolates when content reflows. When a layout container needs to resize, its children may need to change their position. Adding layout animation allows the reflowing of children to happen over time and with a chosen easing curve.'

## Adding Layout Animation

To get started, select a layout component and select the `+` action alongside `Layout Animation` in the inspector. Typically, you may want to set this on the parent layout in the majority of cases.

Next, choose from one of 3 different modes:

- **None:** No animation.
- **Inherit:** Inherit the animation parameters from the parent layout.
- **Custom:** Define the animation parameters for the selected layout.

With the custom option selected, you can set a duration and interpolation type similar to that of a State Machine transition. All interpolation types except cubic value are supported.

With a custom animation applied to a parent layout, setting the child layouts to `inherit` means they'll all use the same parameters as those on the parent. Alternatively, you can choose to apply custom interpolation to child components individually.
