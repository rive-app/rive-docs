description: 'Add animation to a Layout container to define how it interpolates when content reflows. When a Layout container needs to resize, its children may need to change their position. Adding Layout animation allows the reflowing of children to happen over time and with a chosen easing curve.'

## Adding Layout Animation

To get started, select a Layout component and select the `+` action alongside `Layout Animation` in the inspector. Typically, you may want to set this on the parent Layout in the majority of cases.

Next, choose from one of 3 different modes:

- **None:** No animation.
- **Inherit:** Inherit the animation parameters from the parent Layout.
- **Custom:** Define the animation parameters for the selected Layout.

With the custom option selected, you can set a duration and interpolation type similar to that of a State Machine transition. All interpolation types except cubic value are supported.

With a custom animation applied to a parent Layout, setting the child Layouts to `inherit` means they'll all use the same parameters as those on the parent. Alternatively, you can choose to apply custom interpolation to child components individually.
