You can think of Rive layouts a bit like Flex Boxes in CSS, but without being forced to work exclusively in a box model. Rive’s freeform canvas lets you choose which parts of your graphics need to work within the layout system, with the creative freedom to break out of it. This makes Rive Layouts a bit different from other design tools — you get to decide whether an object inside a Layout participates in the Layout engine or not.

Constraints can be used to break out of a layout in a controlled manner. This can create interesting results if you want to animate between a layout position and somewhere unaffected by the layout.
