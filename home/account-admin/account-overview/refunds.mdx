## Our Policy

Per Rive's [Terms of Service](/legal/terms-of-service), fees are non-refundable. If you cancel your subscription, you keep access until the end of your current billing period—we just won't renew it.

## Billing Errors

If you were charged incorrectly (duplicate charge, charged after cancellation, wrong amount), email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) with:

- Your account email
- Date and amount of the charge
- What went wrong

We'll investigate and fix any legitimate billing errors.

## Before You Upgrade

If you're not sure Rive is right for you:

- Use the free plan first to test it out
- Start with monthly instead of annual if you want flexibility
- Double-check you're upgrading the right workspace
