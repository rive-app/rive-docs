title: "Cancel a Former Employee's Subscription"
description: "If an employee left your company but their Rive subscription is still billing your card, we can help cancel it. You don't need access to their account."
---

## What We Can Do

- ✅ Cancel the subscription
- ✅ Remove your payment method from their account
- ✅ Refund recent charges (typically 1-2 months after departure)

## What We Cannot Do

- ❌ Give you access to their account
- ❌ Transfer their files to your company
- ❌ Change workspace ownership

**Why:** Workspace ownership belongs to the account that created it, not the payment method. Even if your company card paid for it, the workspace is theirs. We don't override ownership without the account holder's consent.

If you need the files, you'll need to work that out directly with the former employee.

## How to Request Cancellation

Email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) with:

- Your company name
- The employee's name and email (if known)
- Last 4 digits of the card being charged
- Approximate date the employee left

We'll verify you control the payment method, cancel the subscription, and remove your card. You'll get confirmation within 1-2 business days.

## Prevent This Next Time

Create a company-owned workspace and add employees as members. When someone leaves, you remove them—no subscriptions to chase down, no files lost.
