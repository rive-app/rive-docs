## Before You Start: Delete vs Cancel

These are different things:

- **Cancel** = Stop paying, keep your workspace and files, can reactivate anytime
- **Delete** = Permanent removal, files gone forever

If you just want to stop paying, you probably want [Cancel My Account], not this.

## What Happens When You Delete

**Immediately:**

- ✅ Billing stops (no future charges)
- ✅ All members lose access
- ✅ Workspace disappears from the workspace switcher
- ⚠️ Any Rive animations embedded on external websites will break (visitors see a broken image)

**For 90 days:**

- Workspace sits in a "deleted" state
- Files are preserved but inaccessible
- Can be recovered if you contact support

**After 90 days:**

- ❌ Everything is permanently deleted from our servers
- ❌ Cannot be recovered, no exceptions

## How to Delete a Workspace

### Step 1: Back Up Your Files

This is your only chance. After deletion, files cannot be recovered—not by you, not by support, not by anyone.

For each file you want to keep:

1. Open the file in the editor
2. Right-click the file name
3. Select "Download backup"
4. Save the .rev file somewhere safe

### Step 2: Notify Team Members (Optional)

Members lose access immediately when you delete. If you want to give them time to download their own work first, let them know before you proceed.

To remove members before deletion: [Removing Workspace Members](/account-admin/workspaces/removing-workspace-members)

### Step 3: Delete the Workspace

1. Go to [rive.app/account](https://rive.app/account)
2. Scroll to "Workspaces"
3. Find the workspace you want to delete
4. Click "Manage Workspace"
5. Scroll to the "Danger Zone" section
6. Click "Delete Workspace"
7. Type the workspace name to confirm

⚠️ Double-check you're deleting the right workspace, especially if you have multiple workspaces.

### Step 4: Confirmation

After confirming:

- You'll receive a confirmation email
- Billing stops immediately
- No prorated refund for the current billing period (you already paid for it)

## Special Situations

### I'm Not the Workspace Owner

Only the owner can delete a workspace. Your options:

- Ask the owner to delete it
- Leave the workspace yourself (you can always remove yourself)
- Contact [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) if the owner is unreachable

### The Owner Left the Company

Email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) with proof of company ownership. We can help transfer ownership first, then you can delete.

### I Have Multiple Workspaces

Deleting one doesn't affect others—they're completely independent. Triple-check which one you're deleting using the workspace switcher.

## I Deleted by Mistake

**Within 90 days:** Email [support@rive.app](mailto:support@rive.app) immediately with the subject "Recover Deleted Workspace - URGENT." Include the workspace name, your account email, and when you deleted it. We can restore it.

**After 90 days:** Unfortunately, the data is gone. This is why we really push the backup step.

## Troubleshooting

**I don't see the Delete option** You're probably not the workspace owner. Check who owns it in workspace settings.

**Delete button is grayed out** Usually a billing issue. Resolve any outstanding payments first, or contact support.

**Team members still see the workspace** Cache issue. Have them log out, clear browser cache, and log back in. Should resolve within 30 minutes.
