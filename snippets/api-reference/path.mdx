The **`Path`** type represents a mutable 2D vector path used for drawing shapes in Rive Scripts.
Paths are constructed by chaining commands such as `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `quadTo`, and `cubicTo`, then passed to the `Renderer` for drawing.

Use `Path.new()` to create a fresh path, and reuse paths across frames by calling `reset()` *after* rendering.

---

## Constructors

### `Path.new()`

Creates an empty `Path` ready to draw into.

```lua
local path = Path.new()
path:moveTo(Vector.xy(0, 0))
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(100, 0))
```

## Methods

### `path:moveTo(to: Vector)`

Moves the current point to to without drawing.
Starts a new sub-path.

--- ```lua
--- path:moveTo(Vector.xy(10, 10))
--- ```

### `path:lineTo(to: Vector)`

Draws a straight line from the current point to to, updating the current point.

```lua
path:moveTo(Vector.xy(0, 0))
path:lineTo(Vector.xy(100, 0))
```
